"Food labelling and the amount of added sugar in foods is a hot topic at the moment. Food Standards Australian and New Zealand are currently looking at ways to help people choose lower sugar foods. But a study released on Friday has had a counterintuitive finding, that putting warning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them. Well, to talk us through the findings and what they could mean is one of its authors, Miranda Blake. Welcome Miranda. Thank you for having me, Tegan. So you did an online survey asking people whether they'd buy things like breakfast cereal, yoghurt and non-alcoholic drinks while testing out different styles of sugar warning labels. Were you surprised by the results? Yes, we were, we expected to find that these would affect the likelihood of selecting a high sugar product, and we didn't find that. But systematic reviews with consumers have found that clearer labelling of added sugar on packaged foods does help consumers to pick lower sugar options. So I would say more research is needed. But we also did find that consumers strongly supported clear labelling of added sugar on packaging, so this suggests that if these labels were introduced there would be strong consumer support for that policy. Right, so people weren't…like, they were keen on them but what you're finding didn't really fit with previous findings. What could the disconnect be there? There is always the probability of just random chance in research. I think also we found that consumers are strongly supportive of having that information so that they could make an informed decision. So while we…again, the research does suggest that providing this information could help consumers to make healthier choices, I think the bottom line is also that consumers deserve to have the information to make that informed decision for themselves. Right, because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in a product. That's correct. So in Australia, manufacturers of packaged foods often add sugar to products, like breakfast cereals, yoghurts and drinks, but there is currently no way for Australians to know how much added sugar is in a packaged food, so that's why we tested these seven different labelling options to see if any of them had an impact on the likelihood of selecting a high sugar option. Right, so that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered, despite the overarching outcome of your study. Are there other reasons as well? Yes, so we know that in order to have any other policies around added sugar, so, for example, if we did education campaigns around added sugar or we restricted the marketing of products high in added sugar, we need to know how much added sugar is in products. So it's both important for providing information directly to consumers but also to support other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or, more broadly, to support consumers to select products that are lower in added sugar. Is this going to be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that warning labels should be on packaging? I hope not because I hope that they can see that, again, we had 85% of consumers who agreed that we need to set higher standards for how the food industry labels the foods we eat. And again, the broader evidence does suggest that this probably does help consumers to select healthier options. So, if we do introduce added sugar labelling policies, which the government is currently considering, that policy would need to be paired with an education campaign for consumers, particularly those with lower levels of literacy and numeracy, support them in how to use that information so that they can pick those products that are lower in added sugar. So how does this fit against other things that are on the table, for example, with sugar tax, and whether the new government might be heading in that direction or not? Well, it would be great to see if the Labor government would commit to an added sugar tax, either in food or drinks, preferably both, but I think what we can see is that, again, we need to be able to know how much added sugar is in food before we can introduce any policies. This is a really important step in supporting broader policies to support consumers to eat products that are lower in added sugar that are better for their well-being. How do these sorts of interventions interact with each other if you've got more than one thing happening at once? You've just measured one thing in this study but that's not really how it's going to work in the real world, just briefly. That's right, so we know from the example of tobacco regulation, for example, we saw…you know, over many years more and more policies were put into place, and these can work together, so they can be greater than the sum of their parts. So, added sugar labelling on its own may be made much more effective, for example, by having education campaigns around sugar content and a tax around added sugar as well, so they can work together to support healthy consumer choices. It's one that we are watching closely. Miranda, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks very much for having me.

"So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered the story of a man who was hospitalised with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps, increased thirst, and he had also lost close to 13 kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and it was vitamin D overdose, was it? Yes, vitamin D supplements, he had been taking way too many of them. And I don't know if it's just me but it feels like everywhere that I look I'm seeing other people ODing on vitamin. There was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D, there were women who have accidentally taken so much vitamin B6 that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at ABC Melbourne. Yes, if a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Exactly. So we're going to take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr Ian Musgrave who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi Ian. Hello, how are you? Good. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell. Vitamin overdose is certainly a thing but it seems to come in waves. For example, a lot of the vitamin D overdosing is occurring because people have thought that it might be a good way to prevent Covid. Sadly, tragically it's virtually useless as a preventative for Covid. One of the problems with the B6 is that, as your colleague has said, we all know that vitamins are important for us, we all know that we need vitamins for health, but we think that because a little bit is good for us, a lot maybe is better. And sadly, tragically with vitamins, this isn't true. And also what people don't realise is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what has happened with one person, for example, is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained B6, and it all added up so they ended up with B6 toxicity. It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realising. Yes, indeed. Unless you pay very close attention to what you're taking, you may not understand that there is enough vitamin B in everything you are taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects, especially the water-soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as having potentially toxic effects. But, for example, B6 is one where it's relatively easy to get up to a dose which can cause nerve damage. So we don't necessarily see it as being toxic per se, but if you were taking more than 300, 500 milligrams of B6 over time, it can cause nerve damage. It's something that's not really widely known because until the advent of high potency vitamin supplements, the chances of getting a B6 overdose were marginal. Yes, you weren't going to see it just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? If it's possible to get these sorts of effects, do people need to be better informed by…presumably a lot of the time you are buying them from a pharmacist or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a naturopath or something like that. Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well, they are regulated like medicines in Australia, but having said that I would like to point out that within Australia medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and they are regulated on two levels. You have low risk medicines, like vitamins, which are regulated by the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods where you don't need to require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it because they are assuming that you will read the instructions on the box and take them accordingly. And the registered medicines, which are things like, for example, paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence of them working but also strong evidence about their safety. The upshot is read those labels. Yes, and if it doesn't have an AUSTL or AUSSTAR number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much Dr Ian Musgrave for joining us. Thank you.
