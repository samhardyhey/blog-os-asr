"The Science Show on RN, where we often feature a book in the Wild Dingo Press series, featuring Aussie STEM Stars. And the last one we had on, another real star, was marine scientist Professor Emma Johnston. This time it's a medical star, and here's the author. I'm Deb Fitzpatrick and I'm a writer of books for kids and teenagers. When I was approached by the publisher at Wild Dingo Press to write a new title in their Aussie STEM Star series, I immediately accepted because I was aware of the great reputation the series already had. I was a little nervous, wondering who I would be writing about, but little did I know just what a gift of a story I would be handed when I was asked to write about Professor Ajay Rane. Tellingly, Ajay's response when the publisher approached him with the idea to write a book about him was; you want to write a book about me? This trademark humility shapes his story, as it has his incredible life of caring for others through education, sacrifice and giving. Crucially, the power of education is at the heart of Ajay's story. Ajay's father was the only child in his village in India to receive a secondary education. Poor cotton farmers, none of the villagers could afford to send any of their children to high school, so together, led by Ajay's grandparents, the villagers hatched a plan to pool their money and use it to send one village child to high school. The selection of that child was by recommendation of the local schoolteacher and was Ajay's father, Murli. Murli went on to study medicine and went back to his village to care for those who'd made his success possible. Murli's son Ajay decided from a very young age that he too wanted to be a doctor. Professor Ajay Rane is a surgeon with specialties in obstetrics and gynaecology and urology. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 2013 and has devoted his life to improving women's health through training and educating medical staff all over the world, especially in the country where he spent a large chunk of his childhood, India. Ajay also grows the world's hottest chilis. In the early 2000s, a doctor Ajay had trained with as a young man in India calls him. After the usual catch-up conversation, the now-senior doctor asks Ajay if he would return to Maharashtra to train a group of doctors, himself included, in the special surgeries he does to help women who are injured during childbirth. 'I would love to do that,' says Ajay. 'There's a big group of us. We are very keen to learn from you and, as you know, there is so much need for these skills here.' 'Yes, yes, I understand,' says Ajay. 'I would love to help in any way I can.' 'Thank you, Ajay, we are so appreciative. I'd like to arrange a local medical conference around your visit too, so I'll start getting things in place for that. We look forward to seeing you in Nashik!' Several months later, Ajay flies out to Nashik to treat the local women and teach those interested doctors what he knows. This is the kind of challenge Ajay naturally embraces and he insists on doing the work pro bono. He is always happy to have an excuse to go back to India, to be part of that colourful, dirty, smelly, vibrant place again, with the best food in the world. The doctors greet him at the airport and offer to take him to the fancy hotel they've booked him into. 'No, no, I want to see my patients,' says Ajay. 'We're going to operate tomorrow, so I want to see them today.' The doctors look at each other in surprise. 'Right now?' 'Yes,' Ajay nods. 'I'd like to see them now, please.' One of the local doctors calls the clinic and arranges for the patients to be ready. When Ajay arrives, he sees women sitting on the floor against a wall, in a long line. They are all waiting for him. Ajay smiles warmly at them. They are all poor. They are filthy. He knows they have been treated terribly to this point, but their faces are full of hope. He reaches into his bag and pulls out a bundle of clean white sheets. Ajay turns to the doctors. 'These are what I call dignity sheets. This is the first thing I want to teach you. Never examine a woman without a sheet covering her. Because of their medical problems, these women have been given no respect, treated as though they have no value. That stops here,' he says, 'the minute they come into your care.' It is a long day but Ajay sees every one of those patients, with the other doctors—most of whom are women—standing around him, observing, taking notes and asking questions. Finally, the last patient climbs up onto the examination bed. It's clear from the state of her that she is an extremely poor beggar. She smells awful. When Ajay examines her, he sees that she has a very large hole in her bowel that is leaking faeces. Turning to the other doctors, he says, 'Look, I can fix this, but I can't teach this particular surgery, as it is very complicated. But I'm very happy to operate on this patient.' The doctors speak among themselves. Then they say to Ajay, 'Let's do all the other surgeries first, as we want to learn from you. Then, if we have time, you can operate on this woman.' Ajay says, 'I'm in your town, at your invitation. Of course I'll do what you asked me to do.' Then another voice comes into the conversation. It's the patient on the table. Incredibly, she speaks English, and well. Very clearly, she says, 'If you don't operate on me, I will kill myself.' Everything in the room changes. No one moves or speaks. Ajay turns to the woman. He is appalled to realise how many things he and the other doctors have assumed about her. She is a beggar in a small village of India…who speaks English. 'I am so sorry. I didn't realise you understood English.' 'I'm a nurse,' she says, 'it's the fistula that has thrown me on the dung heap. They took my baby away from me, my husband threw me out of the house, and now I have to gather food on the garbage heaps to survive.' It is one of the most powerful moments of Ajay's life. He vows to help her. The next day they do surgery after surgery. It's a marathon of incisions and stitches, and as the day heads into the late afternoon, Ajay fears he will run out of time for his special patient. 'Where is the other patient, the nurse with the fistula?' he pleads with the local doctors at the end of the day. 'Sorry, Doctor, we have finished the patient list, we can't do any more now.' Ajay had promised to give a lecture to local medical staff and students at 6:30 that evening. He goes to the lecture theatre feeling very unsettled. He keeps thinking about the nurse. He mingles with the guests before the lecture, wearing a smile as he moves from one group of people to the next. But he can't relax; things are not right. He recognises an old friend from medical school, also a gynaecology specialist. He has not seen her in years. They begin chatting, catching up on all their news. 'I'm married to a surgeon,' Daksha says. 'Oh, that's great,' says Ajay, a thought coming into his head. 'So…do you have a hospital?' 'Yes, yes,' she says casually. 'We have trauma patients, obstetrics, childbirth.' 'So, you work 24/7?' he asks. 'Yes, yes.' 'And…do you have an anaesthetist?' 'Oh yes, 24/7,' Daksha says happily. 'Lovely,' says Ajay, standing up a little straighter. 'I would love to operate in your hospital right now.' She looks at him. 'What do you mean?' 'I have a patient.' He lowers his voice. 'She needs an urgent operation. I'll pay for it.' Daksha looks directly at Ajay, and in that instant, understands that he is serious. 'Of course,' she says, face changing. 'Not a problem.' Ajay gives the lecture. He is fired up and it shows. Despite his exhaustion from the last two days of work, he is energised. As soon as he finishes his speech, he excuses himself and heads towards his old friend. They hightail it out of there. The first thing to do is to find the nurse-patient. They ask a few people who give them directions, but the labyrinthine slums are impossible to navigate. Finally, they invite a couple of locals into the car to help them, and they find the patient after a few minutes of weaving up and down lanes of makeshift homes, little more than the size of a family tent. Her face upon seeing them is a vision. Never has Ajay felt such purpose. Yes, a real Aussie STEM Star, via India. And the rest of the story, as written and read there by Deb Fitzpatrick, is in her new book titled Global Crusader for Women's Health .",622.784,10.379733333333332,/Users/samhardyhey/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/mp3/aussie-stem-stars-ajay-rane.mp3,/Users/samhardyhey/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/ground_truth/aussie-stem-stars-ajay-rane.txt,aussie-stem-stars-ajay-rane,1543,148.65507142123113
"And so to a new book called Tunnels in Time , a bit like that midden, except these are through caves and rocks, telling the story of our marsupials. It's written by Lyndall Dawson who now lives on the south coast of New South Wales. Tell me about the Wellington Caves, where are they and why do you think they are important? Wellington Caves are in western New South Wales, they have some tourist caves, nice, interesting tourist caves but they are not Jenolan, they're not anything pretty. They are interesting from a historical point of view, but most importantly they are interesting because they were the first place in Australia that our extinct marsupial species were discovered way back in 1830. Way back in 1830. Was someone looking for them or did they happen to be digging for something else? Actually in a way they were looking for them. At this stage in England the subject of extinct animals was alive and well because the Enlightenment had brought out the fact that maybe everything wasn't biblical, but fossils in England were being discovered and being ascribed to the biblical flood that had wiped them out. And so Australia, even in those days, because it had been settled 50 years before that, was a test case. We knew the fauna was really different here, and if Noah's flood had wiped out the lions and elephants and things that should have lived in Australia, that would prove the point. So people already were interested enough in Australian fauna to be testing that idea. And a chap who evidently was called a gentleman from Bathurst, Rankin, did some exploring around the Wellington area, west of Bathurst and…well, he was climbing into a hole in the ground in the limestone hill and he fell and grabbed a branch or a root or something that snapped off and it turned out to be a giant bone. And he was astute enough to contact the surveyor general, Sir Thomas Mitchell, tell him about it, who was astute enough and knowledgeable enough to know that this was a really important find. So that started it all. The Mitchell? The Mitchell, the Thomas Mitchell, yes. And what did the bone turn out to be? Well, it turned out to be very controversial, it was just a limb bone, but immediately Thomas Mitchell rode across the mountains on his horse to Wellington, that's how important they thought it was, and sampled bones out of that cave, sent them back to England where one of the bones was described by the most important anatomist at the time, Jameson I think, as the tusk of an elephant, which really fired up enthusiasm. I could imagine, it would prove the Bible was true. Exactly, that's right, but Thomas Mitchell himself was educated enough to be very sceptical about that elephant idea. And the other person who came into the story eventually was Sir Richard Owen who… That man. That man, and that man was I think probably one of the greatest geniuses on the planet because he could put these tiny little fragments of bits and pieces of broken bone together and turn them into animals and identify them, and he was always right. And sitting in the main hall of the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, but he wasn't right about evolution because he didn't actually like Darwin's ideas, did he. No, that's right. But he also named dinosaurs. However, that's Richard Owen. Meanwhile in Wellington of course, in the area and other parts of Australia, as you put in your book, the most amazing amount of digging and clearing of ground was going on. Did they actually take care to see whether there were any more bones, or was it just holocaust? Some people were actively looking for bones in those days, particularly up on the Darling Downs had just been settled and people who had just taken up pieces of land there would find big bones sticking out of the creek beds, and so they were interested enough to send them back to the museum and they sent them over to England in vast quantities from Victoria, from Queensland, many, many more from Wellington Caves, and it became a really important subject. It's interesting, isn't it, because your book is in three parts, and what we are talking about is the first part obviously which is the way in which the first explorations were being made just over 150 years ago, and painting a picture of what was a clearly different landscape with different fauna. And did it sink in fairly quickly, that Australia is completely different? Yes, actually, I think under Richard Owen who really took this subject under his wing and got…the Australian Museum opened up a few years after that, about 20 years later, you know… 1827. Richard Owen promoted exploration, found money for it. He by then was quite convinced that these were all marsupials, they were all related to the living fauna and that Australia was unique and different. And they were finding the most extraordinary animals. Diprotodon we know about, which is a hippo-sized wombat, if you like, but what about Thylacoleo? And this is a marsupial lion. What did it look like? It probably looked somewhat lion-like, yes, he had a nice round head with lots of muscles and things and a big jaw, about the same size as a female lion. It certainly was a very interesting controversial journey because, once again, Richard Owen twigged fairly quickly that this was a carnivore, although it had the most unusual dentition, different teeth from anything else and any other carnivore. It wasn't a little bit like Tasmanian Tigers, it had very unique teeth. And that sparked a huge controversy in England because the other anatomists said no, things with teeth like that have to be vegetarian because they have the same sort of teeth as the other…we called them diprotodons, the ones with two bottom teeth and two upper teeth that nibble grass and ate fruit and things like that. Thylacoleo had those sort of incisor teeth, nothing like a carnivore. But Owen stuck to his guns, Owen said it was a carnivore. But even in the 1920s, people were still arguing with that idea and saying it couldn't have been a carnivore. But studies have been done that have absolutely nailed it. And that's nearly 200 years later, it was still controversial. Quite interesting that in a cave in the Nullarbor, John Long and friends found Thylacoleo down in another huge cave, and I think it was several of them but this really was a terribly exciting find. Nullarbor Caves have just been the most exciting new find in the last 20 or 30 years in Australia, instead of all these fragmentary bits of bones that have been broken up, and they found whole skeletons and that's where…they've been putting this jigsaw of Thylacoleo together for 150 years but it didn't ever have a tail, they hadn't found its tail, and sure as eggs, yes, in the Nullarbor Cave they found Thylacoleo's tail, whacko, so they could put the whole animal together. Lyndall, what's your interest in this? Are you an archaeologist, are you a mammalogist or what? I was trained as a zoologist. I was lucky enough to meet up with people like Mike Archer when I was looking for a postgraduate topic, and there was a whole collection of stuff in the Australian Museum that hadn't been touched for 150 years that needed to be looked at, so that became the subject of my PhD. Once again, completely self-taught. And you're quite interested in, of course, the ever-controversial question about how some of these big animals…because you mentioned the Australian Museum, of course they had and still have in exhibition mode a few of these giant animals, huge kangaroo or one of the species of kangaroo you point out because there are many, many different species of kangaroo, and the big animals, the megafauna diminished in number. And in your book you review what might be one of the causes. How do you come up with a conclusion so far? Well, I'm trying carefully to step between the various parties that are interested in this subject, and this is where I first got most interested while I was doing this work at the museum. It became clear to me that people were completely divided in theories about how these things became extinct. One camp was saying that when humans first arrived in Australia, suddenly the megafauna just couldn't cope and were all hunted to extinction. Another camp in those days said that no, it went more along the lines that it did in North America where the ice age was approaching and the climate was changing, so that became extinct. Well, I knew neither of those tales really rang true, there must be something in between. And it's taken 40 years of work, and it's only in the last 20 years that…not my work but enough other work has been done because of improved technology in order to actually bring enough data to sort this controversy out. It's been a very active debate for a long time. A combination of the two; climate and people? Well, that's my theory, yes, because now that we have very good data on about 300,000 years of climate, leading up to a series of ice ages, I call it the rollercoaster of climate, we call it a glacial maximum not an ice age because in Australia it wasn't like Europe or North America where we had ice covering the land, but we did have extremely harsh, dry, cold periods. And the biggest of the megafauna survived up to about 300,000 years ago, this evidence comes from Nullarbor and Naracoorte Caves, that they were all doing very well, but the last two major ice ages after that started to have an impact on the fauna I think, and the evidence is everything was changing in Australia. We were heading into what we are now, an arid country. But one of the things that is pointed out to some extent by you and to some extent by other experts, when you're looking at the fossils of megafauna that have been killed, either by the weather or by people, what you might look for are any kind of cut marks as if they have been hit by clubs or I don't know what, that indicate that there had been violence in the killing rather than just slow demise. There was a story that was very popular in North America way back in the 1960s and 1970s. What I've decided is that Australia and North America had very similar problems with very, very different outcomes for the fauna, but in North America, particularly in Arizona and places like that, they did find deposits of extinct giant sloths and bears with tooth marks and spear points and things like that in them. But it transpires that most of the North American megafauna survived perhaps 30,000 years longer than the Australian megafauna. So the Australian megafauna disappeared perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, and there is no evidence of direct arrowheads or spear points or those sort of things in any of the fossils, except at Cuddie Springs in northern New South Wales there seems to be evidence of dried blood on stone implements, which is surprising after all that time. It could have been possums. It could have been possums, yes. But it doesn't necessarily take a spear to turn something extinct. Look at our koalas and things these days that we are worrying about extinction, but nobody is killing them off, they are just suffering from habitat destruction. So, similar things might have been happening then. It's a lovely book, congratulations. Thank you very much.

"Which diet is best at preventing cancer? And, if you've been diagnosed with cancer, which is more likely to improve your outcome? A wholefood, plant-based diet, or a low-carb ketogenic diet? Dr Neil Iyengar of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York has recently published an extensive review of the evidence. Thank you for having me. I mean, this diet debate goes back ages. I can remember a time when extremely low-fat diets were tested in cancer prevention and indeed improved cancer outcomes. You've focused in this study on a wholefood, plant-based diet and a ketogenic diet. Let's just get the definitions right. What are we talking about in terms of these diets? That is a great question because particularly with the plant-based diets and even the ketogenic diet there's a lot of variation. If we start with the plant-based diet, I generally consider a plant-based diet to be one in which 80% to 90% of the nutritional intake essentially comes from plant sources. And to go one step further, we were particularly interested in wholefood plant-based diets, and this is essentially where we would further define that 80% to 90% as minimally processed or minimally altered plant-based products as the major component of the diet, leaving a little bit of wiggle room for non-plant-based products and that's where we differentiate a plant-based diet from, say, a full-on vegetarian diet or a full-on vegan diet. And when you say on manipulated, you're talking about…it's not a protein ball, it's what Michael Pollan the food writer would say is food that your grandmother would recognise as food. Yes, exactly, this is foods from the garden, if you will, that are minimally altered, cooked in your kitchen, and put on your plate. Okay, let's go to the keto diet because, again, there's lots of confusion here because people are on low carbs, they are on 5:2 diets, they're on time restricted diets. Right, and so when we are talking about a ketogenic diet, at least in the context of this research, we are essentially talking about diets whereby the body is forced to use a different type of fuel, ketone bodies, hence the name of the diet. The way in which a person achieves ketosis is important but may be more variable based on the individual. The more common way to define a ketogenic diet is actually the macronutrient ratio, so the ratios of carbohydrates to proteins to fat. And the majority of ketogenic diets are essentially high in protein and low in carbohydrate, and that's because we are replacing the carbohydrate with protein. When we say low in carbohydrate, we mean very low, generally less than 30 to 40 grams of carbohydrates a day. Let's start with the epidemiological evidence, looking at what trials have been done and also the broad patterns in the population. What do we know about these two diets on a broad front when you look at the population evidence, before we get to the biochemistry and what they do to your body. The vast majority of population or observational evidence is actually regarding plant-based diets. We have several large cohort studies which have looked at the relationship between consumption of mostly plant-based foods and the incidence or the occurrence of various cancers, and what we see there are strong associations that have been found repeatedly across many different studies, many different populations in many different geographic regions, a strong association between higher consumption of plant-based products and lower incidence of several different cancers, predominantly cancers that are related to metabolism, like insulin levels, inflammation, and so these tend to be breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and so forth. At least 13 different cancers are metabolically mediated and have a lower incidence in populations that report higher intake of plant-based foods. And the ketogenic diet? So the ketogenic diet in terms of the observational data is less robust, and this is where we get into difficulties with regard to definitions of the ketogenic diet. Generally speaking we see studies that have categorised diets as low carbohydrate diets. Low carbohydrate diets have been associated with a lowering of risk of some cancers, although the associations are not as strong as what we see in the plant-based diets. But when we really dive down to ketogenic diets, there are very few studies that cleanly look at the relationship in large populations between those who consume ketogenic diet and the incidence of cancer, and the results of those studies are mixed. Some studies have found a protective effect or a protective association I should say, with the ketogenic diet and a few cancers. Now, those studies are a bit problematic because it is difficult to tease out whether it truly was the ketosis or whether or not it was weight loss or other factors that that are achieved with a ketogenic diet that may also be achieved with a plant-based diet. So let's dig down and compare, if you like, the biochemistry, what these diets do in your body, and of course the word on everybody's lips or tongue I should say is microbiome. When you put these side-by-side in terms of a wholefood, plant-based diet and ketogenic diet, what did you find? Well, there's far more data with plant-based diets than there are with ketogenic diets. What we did find was that individuals or populations that consume plant-based diets seem to have far more favourable changes in their gut microbiome than those who consumed ketogenic diets. There are some studies that suggest that the diversity of the gut microbiome may actually decrease with ketogenic diets, and that's likely related to more singular sources of protein, namely animal. You also looked at where you lose your weight from when you are on these two diets, and your suggestion is that on the ketogenic diet you lose more muscle. Yes, one of the things that we are very concerned about is body composition. Individuals with advanced cancer can have wasting syndromes or cachexia where they have a very low volume of muscle. And we also know that muscle can be protective against the development of cancer. One of the things we were interested in in our review of the available data was whether or not these diets differentially impacted body composition. And we did generally see for those who were using either diet, the plant-based diet or the ketogenic diet, for weight loss purposes, we did see that those who consumed plant-based diets were more likely to lose higher amounts of fat compared to muscle, whereas individuals consuming a ketogenic diet with the goal of weight loss had either an equal loss of fat and muscle or sometimes a greater loss of muscle than fact, which was particularly concerning as we know that muscle is protective against the development of cancer. Half the world seems to be on either a 5:2 diet, in other words five days of fairly free eating, two days maybe on 500 calories each which are ketogenic days, or time restricted eating where you don't eat anything from maybe 8 o'clock in the evening until about 1- or 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Have any of those being tested in terms of cancer prevention or the effects on the body that might lead to cancer prevention? There is great interest in time mediated feeding and fasting. It turns out that fasting has positive impacts on insulin levels which of course is a protective effect against cancer. However, individuals who follow an intermittent fasting type diet after achieving a healthy body weight, for example, may actually be exposing themselves to a higher risk of losing muscle mass, and from a cancer perspective, again, that is very concerning. One of the first questions that any cancer specialist gets from someone with cancer after they've got over the shock of the diagnosis is, 'How should I change my diet, Doctor, to benefit myself?' Did you come to any sort of answer there? Because clearly if diets change your metabolism, diets can affect how your cancer progresses and it might even interfere or enhance the drugs you are giving. What did you discover about that? This is such an important question and I think that historically we as oncologists have really not paid enough attention to this question, even though patients are asking us this question, as you pointed out. My strong recommendation is to follow a plant-based diet. But I will make one major caveat to that and that is that there are certainly very specific types of cancer where the ketogenic diet may actually be beneficial, and we are studying about in randomised controlled trials. But by far for most cancers the plant-based diet carries the most cancer protective effects. And which cancers are they that may have a ketogenic benefit? Well, there are certain tumours that are highly dependent on insulin or that are treated with medications that drive up insulin levels. And while a plant-based diet can be very successful at lowering those insulin levels, there are actually studies in mice which suggests that for tumours which have a specific type of genetic mutation called a PI3-kinase mutation, specifically breast tumours with PI3-kinase mutations that are treated with PI3-kinase inhibitors, the ketogenic diet may be beneficial for improving the efficacy of that cancer treatment. That needs to be proven in humans and we have an ongoing study that is testing that question. But there are other PI3-kinase mutated cancers, like certain blood cancers or leukaemias, where the ketogenic diet may actually have the opposite effect and be harmful. So before we go recommending the ketogenic diet for every person with that kind of cancer, a PI3-kinase mutated cancer, we really need to wait for the human diet, and in the meantime the plant-based diet still appears to be protective for those types of cancers. So, the bottom line, Neil, is whether you've got cancer or you are trying to prevent it, bias yourself towards a wholefood, plant-based diet, watch how you lose your weight so that you maintain muscle mass, and retain ketogenic diets, at least at the moment, for highly specific situations. That is exactly what I would conclude from our current state of the evidence. Thank you very much for joining us on the Health Report. My pleasure, thank you for having me.

"Meanwhile, those ethical concerns about AI she was mentioning and which we featured in The Science Show in May as Elon Musk spoke about his ambitions for implanting chips in brains. Here's a philosopher, Professor Frederic Gilbert, with his concerns. We are very interested in understanding being implanted with artificially intelligent neural devices. It is unclear how these smart technologies are impacting our sense of urgency, sense of understanding, our concept of identity, for instance, which all have ramifications in terms of some legal territories. If a device is, for instance, smarter than you in deciding going towards a specific alternative, does it mean that you are less responsible, less accountable, is it the device, is it the manufacturer, is it the programmer, the coder? All these questions are quite interesting and, in a way, very novel actually. Saying, 'Look, it wasn't my fault, Officer, it was the implant in my head, you know, the technology made me do it.' Yes. We conducted interviews with implantees, so we do have actually data that cover these observations. So we have got a human implanted in labs and they report having the device manifesting false positives. So, suddenly the device will start moving on its own without any intention from the patient. So these create a strange situation when the implantee will question themself, will doubt themself. That's within a lab, but if you can imagine if you were sitting at a table, there's a fork, there's a knife and suddenly the artificial limb that you are commanding with your mind is jumping on the knife instead of the fork, and that leads to an accident or a reprehensive act. So who actually is responsible? So here you've got an implant, and we've seen this demonstrated a number of times going back two, three, four, five years indeed where people who've got some sort of restriction on their limbs, movement, can have an implant that then enables them to connect with a computerised system that moves another limb, some sort of prosthetic implement, is that right? That's correct, yes. And nowadays the implants are bidirectional, so five years ago, six years ago you would have the capacity as a paralysed individual to activate a prosthetic limb, so bring, for instance, chocolate to your mouth or drink Coca-Cola, whatever you want, but nowadays it's possible to induce a sense of touch in the brain of someone paralysed. So in other terms, you can blindfold the implantee, touch the artificial limb, which is simply connected to a computer and a chip in the brain, and they exactly know which finger you are touching, without seeing it. The two of us now are sitting in Hobart, Tasmania, and someone could be implanted in Seattle and the prosthetic limb could be with us here in Hobart and we would be touching the prosthetic limb and the person in Seattle would know exactly which finger we are touching. So that raises the question about appropriation, ownership. So at what point your body stops to be yourself? Does it mean that if you're plugged into a computer which is connected to an arm, is that still you, or it's an extended mind process? This raises a very interesting question about how to define identity, for instance, or agency. Well, a few weeks ago we broadcast the idea that the work that Elon Musk is planning, Neuralink, whereby you can have implants in your brain, for example, to do useful things, may in fact go too far. And Allan McCay from the University of Sydney suggested that we should follow Chile with our restrictions legally on how far you can go with that. Do you think he has a case? I think we still need to discuss and explore these questions. In terms of the Chilean provision, they have modified again the Constitution, so I think prior to jumping to something as fundamental in a society we should look into penal law or civil law in order to restrict or narrow the power or the operation of companies. I have some doubt about the fact that we might need that now. Perhaps 100 years, I'm not sure if we will ever have the capacity to clearly read the mind of anyone, because the concern behind the neural rights is that the technologies will be capable of extracting very secretive thoughts in your brain, be able to read your mind. That would mean that you could go to scan someone's brain and know exactly their political orientation, their most sacrosanct secrets, but this is quite inspired by some romantic… Science fiction. Yes, science fiction, but there's a bit of mythology into it as well. Yes, if you look at the actual physiology, all those signals, because we've got trillions really of connections going on in our brains, and you've got a little old chip stuck there, okay, it can handle a number of transmissions and signals, but things like concepts and ideas, and we've got very complicated brains compared to other animals. So to be able to work out thoughts and ideas and intentions and emotions…well, perhaps emotions to some extent, what do you think? Yes, emotions or some of these experiments have established very extraordinary outcomes, for instance if you watch an elephant and a giraffe for a long time, we know exactly which neuron is looking at what and then you scan their brain, you know there was an elephant. But between 'I'm looking at an elephant' and 'I believe that the next election should be won by this person because I believe that this is my system of values', it's quite complicated. Does it mean that we might not get close to some emotions, feelings in the future, but at the same time we are capable of reading anyone's face and read emotion out, so why would AI… Because if you are in San Diego and you want to know what Fred is doing and his thoughts, you implied that as long as you are connected, they could read you anywhere. Yes, clearly, there are potential interesting applications, also this obsession of reading the mind of a criminal, for instance. There are very powerful technologies out there that can predict brain activity. So we have great colleagues here in Australia that are leaders in the field of predicting epilepsy, for instance, and we know that as long as you train a machine that can identify a biomarker for a specific reaction or context, we know that we can derive that into predicting some degree of an episode of depression, aggressive outbursts, this is how closed loop devices are working now in clinical trials. But again, these are very specific brain activities in some specific contexts, and you won't be able to reduce these manifestations of the mind via just a few interactions. That being said, it doesn't mean that we should not protect humans against potential abuse. How does your own work pertain to this though, what are you doing? Yes, so we are pioneering the human–computer interaction fields, so we're trying to understand how a device, for instance, that is effective, meeting the therapeutic endpoint, can in fact be generating harm to the patient. The strange thing is that we have observed in clinical trials that some patients having the device working perfectly well will start to have psychological rejection. And again, it's quite surprising to know that we are investing so much in these technologies, they are very promising, but when you actually test them in patients, they are working but there is psychological rejection, or there is an outcome or a phenomenology that you couldn't expect and it wasn't designed when they first started to think and build that technology. But that abreaction, in other words people who can use an artificial arm via this kind of technology by thinking, how many of those are having that sort of bad reaction? It's a very difficult question to answer because we are talking about cutting-edge implants. There are about 25 humans that have been implanted with these on the planet, so we are not yet there where we can run a significant statistic. But we can learn from previous generations of implants, such as open brain stimulation, for instance, and there is a significant number of patients that are implanted, having their symptoms gone, but start to have post-operative depression or personality change, manifesting hypomania, hypersexuality, having their families not recognising them. Several patients say 'I don't feel like the same person since I've been implanted', but again, the symptoms are gone. So the medical mission is accomplished but there is always this psychological dimension that one can have with themself which is not very faithful or does not capture their hope or expectation with the treatment. So to answer your question, we don't have yet the number for these new technologies and we would need to have more ethicists embedded within these clinical trials to discuss and think about potential concerns. And to your point of being a great billionaire investing their talent and their money into that, there is a risk that we might see upscaling of the technology that might not match the necessity of the participant, the individual involved in the trials. So you think Musk should be stopped? No, no, no, not at all, I'm not saying that at all. I think we are lucky to have someone as clever and smart as him. Obviously there is a lot of speculation surrounding the technology, and a few times when Mr Musk, he went on some PR mission where he was trying to get money, so I remember in 2017 he went to Dubai, to a conference, and he was able to get $27 million in one evening. So, who can do that? So the fact that people believe in him, it's promising, but obviously we have to be careful about the purpose, how the technology will serve us in the future. Keep working, it's very useful, thank you. Thank you.

"G'day, Dr Karl here. Have you ever geared up for the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb? You have to take everything out of your pockets, especially metal coins. How come? Could you really kill somebody by dropping a coin from a great height? As it turns out, people around the world have done different versions of this experiment and the answer is almost certainly a resounding ""no"" – at least with regular coins. In the early 2000s, the physicist Lou Bloomfield from the University of Virginia tried to mimic the dropping of a coin from a tall building. He cleverly combined helium balloons with a radio-controlled mechanism to release the coin once the balloon got high enough. He then tried to catch the falling coins. He caught, and even got hit, by a few of the falling coins. He said that it was not painful, and that it felt like being flicked by a finger on the forehead – ""… but not even very hard"". According to the popular science journal, the Scientific American, he said, ""The pennies didn't hurt. They bounced off me and it felt like getting hit by bugs, big raindrops, or little hail pellets. No bruises, no injuries. I was laughing the whole time."" Now, given that a coin is made from dense metal, how come the falling coins didn't even hurt him? The short answer is that they were not falling fast enough. On one hand you do have the ever powerful suck of gravity pulling the coin towards the ground ever faster with each passing second – but to get this continual acceleration, the coin has to fall in a vacuum. Our regular coin is falling down, however, in our atmosphere. So gravity gets opposed by the atmosphere. Furthermore, our coin doesn't fall vertically straight down, but flutters to the ground like a leaf – sliding left and then right while being roughly horizontally aligned. Now I'm talking about your average coin, weighing a gram or two, and about a centimetre or two across. I'm definitely not talking about the South African gold coin called the Krugerrand, which weighs about 33 grams and is about 33 millimetres across. If one of those were to fall edge first, it could build up some considerable speed and cause some damage – thanks to its weight and vertical alignment. But with your average falling coin, after about 15 metres of falling, the suck of gravity is balanced by the resistance of the wind – and the coin reaches the speed chillingly known as its Terminal Velocity. However, in our atmosphere, this speed is relatively low – around 45-50 km/h. If there was no atmosphere, a coin could accelerate to around 335 km/h which is fast enough to cause some damage if it hits somebody. According to studies from the American National Rifle Association, 110 km/h is enough to penetrate the skin, while 220 km/h will shatter bone. Atmosphere is one thing, but shape is another. For example, a falling heavy metal ballpoint pen could cause huge damage if it fell from a great height. If it were to drop vertically like an arrow, the combination of its terminal velocity of around 300 km/h, combined with its small hard-pointed end, could penetrate a human skull. Certainly, bullets fired vertically, definitely cause damage on the return leg to Earth. Depending on the weight and shape of the falling bullet they can reach speeds between 330 and 770 km/h on the way down. In Kuwait after the end of the Gulf War, the Kuwaitis celebrated by firing weapons into the air – and 22 people died from falling bullets. In Los Angeles, between the years 1985 and 1992, the King-Drew Medical Centre treated 118 people for Random falling-bullet injuries. 38 of them died, while most of the survivors were left with severe long-term disabilities, such as chronic pain, seizures, paraplegia and quadriplegia. In Sydney, a nine-year-old Sydney girl was watching fireworks with her parents from their driveway to celebrate the incoming New Year of 2002. At five minutes after midnight, a bullet fell out of the sky and lodged in her upper arm. A few centimetres closer to her centreline, and she could've been killed. The Mythbusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, tried a variation of this experiment. They made a mini cannon that could fire a small coin at around 100 km/h – about twice the speed of a falling coin. They aimed it into one of their favourite props, a ballistics dummy, which ended up with only minor damage. Then, made courageous by this knowledge, they fired coins at each other. Yes, they did sting, but no, they did not cause any damage. When a coin landed on Adam's hand, he said it hardly hurt. And that coin was moving faster than a coin dropped from the Empire State building, or the Sydney Harbour Bridge. But if it were raining cats and dogs, well, that would be a whole different box of frogs.",422.424,7.0404,/Users/samhardyhey/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/mp3/deadly-falling-coins.mp3,/Users/samhardyhey/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/ground_truth/deadly-falling-coins.txt,deadly-falling-coins,834,118.45917845576956
"Hello, I'm Robyn Williams, and we start this adventure in the Queensland Museum in Brisbane where Sophie Price is about to help open the Coral Connections exhibition. The question is, how did people first come here, apart from starting at the top end? And the answers come from some stunning new archaeology. My name is Sophie Price, I'm the Assistant Curator of Anthropology at Queensland Museum Network. But you're normally in Townsville, are you? I am, yes, so I work at the Museum of Tropical Queensland in Townsville but that's within the Queensland Museum Network, so we are spread across the four campuses across the state. And I imagine crossing the Coral Sea they would have come to the area which is now called Townsville rather more quickly than Brisbane. Absolutely, it was really important that we had this exhibition first up at the Museum of Tropical Queensland last year as the first instance of the exhibition, and then it has come down here to share the story with south-east Queensland. I must say that I've always thought of people first coming to Australia from the kind of Macassan region, Indonesian archipelago and so on from the straight north. But coming from the east, how long has that been well-known? Well, it's a really interesting story and I think we are only starting to really delve into the depth of that. So this exhibition that CABAH is doing and that the museum is assisting with in the exhibition, it's all based with the traditional owners on Jiigurru, on the Lizard Island and up in that Dingaal country, and it's telling a different sort of story, so instead of talking purely about human expansion, you know, straight to Australia, we are looking at human expansion down the coast of Queensland and how long ago that was happening and what was happening at the same time. But how long did it take? A long time, I think. You'll see in the exhibition there's some canoes and it would have taken a long time to traverse the sea. Let's go in. And I can see four canoes now. They're quite large actually. And before you had horses, of course water was the main real fast…that humans could travel and explore. Yes, absolutely, and it was really important for us to showcase the size and the extent of these canoes, of these seafaring vessels, so the first section of the exhibition you are really introduced to that concept of seafaring and how people moved and how they were transferring ideas and objects across the water. Some people suggested that not just the canoes but some of the sailing boats, and you've got one here in front of me, it looks very swish, one of the greatest inventions in human history. I would second that, absolutely. You look at the size of them and the significance of them and they are just amazing objects, so, definitely incredible. Okay, there's a long set of three canoes here. One of them is about four, five metres long. Yes, longer, it's almost up to six metres I believe. So we've got them stacked up on the wall and that's just showing the size of these ones, and then over the other side of the exhibition we actually have a fully formed outrigger canoe from Yarrabah, we call it bunul in the language from Yarrabah, and it is the only canoe that we have in the collection here that still has its outrigger attached, so it's really, really important. They look as if they are carved from one tree. They are, yes, and it's amazing when you think of the size of what the tree would have looked like and then transferring that into an object. So you've got to know what you want to achieve, it's a bit like making a statue with a lump of rock. Definitely, I would say it's even more crafty. Where do these three come from? These ones are actually drift canoes, so they would have come down from PNG and then they've washed up onto land up in the Cape region and then they've been collected. And they've been in a museum ever since? They have been, yes, so I think these ones were all early 1900s, one of them was collected around the 1930s, 1940s. Yes, very old. Does anyone know at this distance in time whether the explorers knew where they were going? That's an interesting question. Without the context of these particular objects, we can't be sure. With some of the other objects and obviously with oral histories from our traditional owners, they know where they were going and they know what their ancestors were doing. Some of the clues of course…we once did a Science Show series on the invention of navigation, but from the ark of course the whole point of sending up the dove, the dove would go into the sky and spot dry land and go off in that direction. So if you watched the animals, and indeed the coconuts floating, you could get clues. Yes, absolutely, and just on that point we do have…when you walk into the exhibition we've got this beautiful constellation that you walk underneath, and that's Tagai and that's a Torres Strait Islander constellation and it's one of the key ones that people were using up in the Straits to navigate across those waters, so it's very similar. Further around, before I talk to one of your colleagues, wonderful carving, it looks as if it has a great big rudder, it's very beautiful… Yes, we've got canoe prows and washboards, so these are, again, are telling that seafaring story and just showing intricacy of the detail as well of all of these crafts. And further along here, we talk about the generations who are involved, there's a wonderful picture of the sea people, mostly men. Did women travel much, do you know? As far as I know women didn't travel on these canoes, definitely not up in the Straits or Cape York that I'm aware of. However, that might be knowledge that's not shared with us in the museum, and yes, we will have to look into that further. Are you an anthropologist? Yes, so I work in anthropology, so particularly First Nations and social history. Before I let you go, just one quick glance over here, which looks like some of the material that came out of the boats, from beads, tools… Yes, all sorts of things, so this area of the exhibition is talking about that cultural exchange, so it's looking at in particular all of the items that were shared across the Coral Sea, so between the cultural groups of New Guinea, Torres Strait, and North Queensland, and it also goes into items that weren't shared, so it's looking at the agency and the decision-making of all these cultural groups, what they wanted to share and what they didn't. Thank you very much, very exciting. Thank you so much, I hope you enjoy. Sophie Price, and her message clearly is these connections were not a one-way passage, this was a lively to-ing and fro-ing like any sophisticated interaction between communities across the Coral Sea over 6,000 years ago. And so to the distinguished Professor of Indigenous Archaeology from Monash, down the hole, Ian McNiven. At the exhibition there's a wonderful sequence of you down the hole, which is a deep hole going down thousands of years, and it looks as if it's a wall until you look closer and you can see the stones and also thousands of large shells showing that's where people ate all those years ago. What were you measuring down that hole? History, in a word, but thousands of years of Aboriginal history, and that's why we do it and that's why we've spent a lot of time…I mean, I spent days down that hole, but it's because we know it's all going somewhere and it's this wonderful understanding that you have that Aboriginal people have been in places literally for thousands of years, and there it is right in front of your eyes, you're just seeing thousands of meals layered up in front of you. So it's a wonderful experience, it's a wonderful privilege to be able to do this sort of work and, boy, if I can get paid to stand in a hole for weeks… Making notes, yes, but the wonderful point that you make is that people might have said that's a midden, in other words that's a rubbish dump, it is not, it's systematic, and you've also got Lapita pottery. They didn't think that there was pottery around in that area, and what you describe of that sort of discovery was it's amazing stuff, it's really ground-breaking stuff, literally. Well, you never know what you're going to find when you do archaeology and that's why we do it because it's always full of surprises. And what I like about what we've done working on Lizard Island is that we knew there were lots of places there where Aboriginal people have been, it's their home. It might be a shell midden, and that's what archaeologists call it, but at the end of the day this is somebody's home and it's been home for hundreds of generations of people, so we always have that in mind. But yes, the pottery we've found…we're not too sure whether it actually is Lapita or might be just after Lapita. Either way, it's related somehow. That's a group of people, the Lapita people. Yes, the Lapita people who are the famous people who first went out into the Pacific to settle the remote Oceania. We only ever thought that they went out, basically headed east, but now we know that there was another arm of Lapita that came along the south coast of Papua New Guinea and possibly the last Lapita people or the next few generations then moved further west, came into Torres Strait, and those influences came down the Queensland coast with Aboriginal people. So there's something going on between 2,000 to 3,000 years ago where everybody is connected over thousands of kilometres on these what we call canoe highways where ideas and objects are being shared, and we've seen that right here in this exhibition. There are a couple of surprises about what you've done here, and one of them is we imagine of course human beings out of Africa, it's as if they knew where they were going over thousands of years, down to Australia, 65,000 years ago. But what you show with the excavations is that people were coming and going, they didn't just come down south, they went north as well. Well, I started going to Torres Strait 25 years ago but we had no idea that we were going to find pottery there as well, so that was all new because historically there is no pottery in Torres Strait, but there we found it, between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago. And of course, as most people know, Aboriginal people did not traditionally make pottery. So when we were doing the work on Lizard Island, we were shocked, literally shocked to find this pottery buried deeply in this shell midden. And it talks to the history of Aboriginal people that, as you say, it's not isolation. Aboriginal people have been interacting with people overseas, we know that with the Macassans over perhaps 1,000 years, we're not too sure, but also there's another connection that goes up through Torres Strait into Papua New Guinea. So Aboriginal people have had international relationships, trading relationships, social relationships, family relationships going back for thousands of years that extend beyond our shores, and I find that a fantastic story. How come you were working so far north when in fact you are based in Melbourne? It's cold. I'm originally from Queensland, I'm very committed to the history and the Indigenous history and cultures of Queensland, so I love working up here. And what would your message be to the public now that this exhibition is open, telling this amazing story, why should they come along to the Queensland Museum? Because it will change the way that you view the history of Queensland, it will change the way that you view the Indigenous people of Queensland. There are things here that you will see that we literally did not know existed up until a couple of years ago. So, if you want a new experience, a new understanding of the state that you live in, come along to this exhibition. Thanks Ian. Thank you, Robyn. Ian McNiven is Professor of Indigenous Archaeology at Monash. And a final word from Sean Ulm, deputy director of the Centre of Excellence of Biodiversity and Heritage. He's usually based in Cairns, northern Queensland. We are standing next to the representation of the hole in the ground where Ian was. What do you think of that? One of the best things you've done, you were saying? This excavation has been extraordinary on Jiigurru or the Lizard Island group, working in partnership with the traditional owners. There are very few middens anywhere in Australia, and particularly on the east coast of Australia, that are as deep as this one. So the lowest cultural material at this excavation was at nearly two metres, and those shells at two metres down were reef shells from the edge of the reef crest at the edge of the lagoon and they still had the colour on them, and they are radiocarbon dated at 6,500 years ago, and they were buried so rapidly that the sun didn't have time to bleach the colour of them. It's an incredibly rare thing in my career, working around the world on coastal sites, to see such extraordinary preservation. But the real humdinger of this was the pottery that we found. Between 60 and 80 centimetres below the surface we found dozens of sherds of pottery dating between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago which we believe to be the oldest pottery in Australia. Quite extraordinary, isn't it, and what I love about this exhibition, apart from the fact that we've got a simulacrum of being down the hole, being down the dig, is you've got a screen there where visitors can point to a sort of lump and it explains what it is and shows you the creature that might have been and how deep it is and how old it is. Well done. Absolutely. One of our real priorities here was to get this into the public realm. So, very few people have the opportunity to visit an archaeological site or a cultural place and participate in an archaeological excavation. So, right from the beginning of the project we were thinking of ways we could develop outreach products. So, a 3D, full-scale print of the pit, so that people could actually touch and feel and stand inside the pit was one part of it, but the interactive screen was really important, particularly for school outreach. And you might have noticed, Robyn, that we've got Indigenous language names in that interactive display and throughout the exhibition, which is really honouring that Indigenous centred approach to the entire partnership that gave rise to this project. Well Sean, you are about to open with the distinguished parties, including the director of the museum, so congratulations and thank you. Thanks again, Robyn. That was Distinguished Professor Sean Ulm, James Cook University, based in Cairns. He is also deputy director of the Centre of Excellence for Biodiversity and Heritage, which also mounted the exhibition that has just opened at the Queensland Museum in Brisbane.",829.88,13.831333333333333,/Users/samhardyhey/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/mp3/exhibit-shows-voyages-of-ancient-cultures-around-the-coral-sea.mp3,/Users/samhardyhey/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/ground_truth/exhibit-shows-voyages-of-ancient-cultures-around-the-coral-sea.txt,exhibit-shows-voyages-of-ancient-cultures-around-the-coral-sea,2621,189.49727671470575
"Now, did you hear on PM a couple of weeks ago that news from Queensland about how dinosaurs managed to stride about on land, carrying such vast weight without crushing their delicate feet, those intricate bones. Here's more, the professor from the University of Queensland, Steve Salisbury, who solved the mystery, they think, with his PhD student. We are at the museum in Brisbane. What has been the response to some of your news about ways in which these amazingly large creatures got around by seeming to be on tippy-toes? I constantly have to remind people of the fact that dinosaurs and their living relatives, birds, walk on their toes. So when you look at a bird and you think you are seeing a knee, it's actually the ankle. So, most of the foot is elevated, it's only the toes that are flat on the ground. Same as horses. Similar to horses. Horses walk on the tips of their toes, and so they are literally on the nail. The horse's hoof, that's the last digit of the central toe, so they are walking on the tips of their toes. The thing we notice about animals when they start to get big, so when we look at the biggest animals that are alive today, things like elephants, is that their limbs become quite column-like because it's easier to support a lot of weight when you have everything centred underneath, one bone centred under another. And it's often assumed that the same thing happened with dinosaurs. I mean, when we see animations of dinosaurs, particularly the really big ones like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus and stuff in things like Walking with Dinosaurs or Jurassic Park and stuff, their feet are often modelled off elephant feet because this is what we typically think of when an animal gets really big, that it must've had feet like that. But dinosaurs didn't have feet like elephants, and the tracks they left behind also look really different. So we've been wondering what's going on, particularly with the really big ones, the sauropod dinosaurs. You know, when they are reconstructed like other dinosaurs, their feet have their toes on the ground but the rest of the foot elevated, but that means there's this big void in the heel area, and was that a void or was there something under there? By the way, what's the one we're looking at over here? It's big enough. What is it? So, that's the hind leg of Rhoetosaurus brownei . It's a sauropod from near Roma in south-western Queensland. It's about 160-165 million years old, and it's one of the most complete hind legs of any dinosaur from the southern hemisphere, it's a fantastic fossil. Is that the one discovered by the famous Scott Hocknull? No, no, this one was found a long time ago, back in the 1920s. Really interesting. But tell me, how did you analyse this? Was it from the tracks as well as from the skeletons and so on, doing the engineering as well? There's a bit of both. I have spent a lot of time tracking dinosaurs in the Kimberley, looking at their footprints. And there are literally thousands of footprints of gigantic sauropod dinosaurs in the Kimberley, and some of them are over 1.7 metres long, they are incredibly huge, and they all seem to show this elongated heel area which means there's something happening in the foot that isn't apparent in the skeleton. So I got one of my PhD students, Andréas Jannel, to have a close look at initially Rhoetosaurus and then other sauropod dinosaurs to try to figure out what was going on. So the main technique that we used was a thing called finite element analysis which is where you model all the bones in 3D and then simulate loading, certain physical properties, and then you apply forces similar to what the animal would have experienced in real life. Normally that sort of thing is used on bricks or aircraft wings or something, immobile simple shapes. A dinosaur foot is much more complicated and there's many parts to it, so it was quite a complex model to build. But when we loaded the models, and so Andréas looked at Rhoetosaurus , we looked at Giraffatitan , we looked at some of the early ancestors to things like the sauropods, so animals like Plateosaurus from Germany, and what we found was, regardless of the posture that we reconstructed the foot in, whether we had the toes on the ground, the toes partly elevated, the whole foot on the ground, however we did it, when we simulated loads equivalent to what some of these animals might have been like in life, and the big ones probably weighed over 50 metric tonnes… 50 tonnes! It's like five or six times the mass of the biggest animal that's alive today… Imagine tap dancing like that. I know, so you kind of think, you know, there's a huge amount of weight being carried by these feet. And what we found was regardless of the posture, without some kind of padding, a cushion beneath the heel, the bones of the foot would have literally cracked under the weight of these animals. So we've been able to demonstrate for the first time through simulated testing that there must have been some sort of soft tissue pad beneath the heel in these dinosaurs, which was really exciting because it confirms what we see in the footprints. By the way, a couple of weeks ago we had Steve Brusatte from Edinburgh, the great dinosaur and mammal man now with his new book, The Reign of the Mammals , and he was pointing out that in fact there were quite a few things about the lizards and the giant ones, the dinosaurs, that was different. For instance, the way their bones were organised, a bit like birds to some extent, that made them lighter because birds need lighter bones to be able to fly, and that would have made the movement slightly different. Have you come across that as one explanation as to how they could be mobile, dinosaurs in the old days? Well, one of the things we see in a lot of dinosaurs, particularly those on the lineage that gave rise to birds, the Saurischian dinosaurs, so all the meat-eating dinosaurs, and the sauropods like Rhoetosaurus , there's a lot of cavities within the bones, their bones were very pneumatic. And similar to birds, they seemed to have had an air sac system that sort of perforated large parts of the skeleton. So with the sauropod dinosaurs, for instance, we see a lot of spaces for these air sacs through the neck and in the vertebral column, and this might have been one of the ways that they were able to support the massive structures that they…you know, with their neck and tail and the body and get so big and still be relatively heavy.

"One of the common questions that Tegan and I get about Covid is why there's so much variation in how people respond to the infection. One answer is in your genes, and there is a massive ongoing study into comparing people's genomes with how COVID-19 has affected them. Dr Gita Pathak is a team leader in what's called the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Gita is based at Yale University's School of Medicine in the United States. Thank you for inviting me, I really appreciate it. So you're not mapping the virus here, you're mapping the people who were infected with the virus to see what happens to them and whether there are specific genes involved in their experience of the virus. That is correct. The goal of the study is to understand human genetics response to the viral infection which we know as COVID-19. We wanted to look at three different outcomes of COVID-19, specifically people who were critically ill from Covid, then people who were hospitalised due to Covid, and people who tested positive for Covid, so the least severe of the three definitions, and which genes might be associated with these three outcomes. And how many genomes have you managed to test? 60 studies from 25 countries, and that resulted in close to 3 million individuals' genetic profiles, and we found a total of 23 genes that show an association with COVID-19. So, let's take severity, and this is in a European population, by and large, a Caucasian population. Have you found any consistency in genes for severe disease? Yes, so genetic ancestry is different than what someone may identify themselves as, like ethnically or geographically. Mostly we do have genetic ancestry of the European descent, but we also had people who are genetically South Asian, East Asian, African ancestry, and that separate from where they are geographically or what they identify as. So this is a bit like 23andMe or Ancestry.com where you send off your genes and you find out that you are 50% Greek and you didn't think you were 50% Greek. Correct. When we are looking at genetic profiles, it's really important to adjust for genetic ancestry and not specifically for what somebody identifies as. Some genetic variation is more common in one ancestry over others, and if we include people from these diverse ancestries, we can pick up these signals much more quickly… So, for example, it was said in the early part of the pandemic that people of South Asian origin had more severe disease and a higher risk of death. Did that pan out in your study? We did find one of the genetic variants that was more common in South Asian populations relative to other populations, but that is just one variant. Genes tend to perform in a similar way across ancestries. They may vary based on their frequency in different ancestries, and that information helps us capture why one ancestry might be exhibiting a higher response or a softer response, but by and large all the genes we saw, they tend to have a similar effect across all ancestries. And what with these genes doing to increase your vulnerability to severe disease? Some of the genes that we found were related to different lung functions. So, for example, we found something called SFTPD which is a lung surfactant protein, and it has already been known to be associated with different pulmonary functions, and there are other studies which have shown that this specific gene has been known with respiratory distress syndrome in different populations. And just to explain, surfactant is the fluid, if you like, that lines the tubes of your lungs and keeps them open, and it's what is deficient in premature babies, causing the respiratory disease of the premature baby. So, in other words, a deficiency of this in adults may predispose you, unsurprisingly, to severe disease. The question of course on everybody's lips now is why do some people not seem to catch COVID-19? There's a group of people who appear anecdotally to be resistant. Did you find COVID-19 resistance genes? Not in our work. Depending on how we look at the variant, the varients we find are associated with the COVID-19 outcome, but if there are people who may be on the opposite spectrum of these, so let's say who are not carriers of this, they might be generally resistant to Covid but that specific study we haven't performed, but that's a good question for later. And just finally, any therapeutic insights that might direct people towards more effective medications to treat people who've got Covid, or prevent it getting worse? One good thing that we understand from this work is that we now have a good number of genes to specifically focus our efforts into, and now this can lead to efforts of drug repurposing or drug development. Did we find a specific drug? No, but we definitely found several targets that now could be investigated for different drugs. Gita, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me, I really appreciate it.

"Dung beetles. We have many, but we need more it seems. Here's an extract from one of my favourite ABC programs from a couple of weeks ago, Country Breakfast on RN. So we're looking for a cow pat with a little bit of dirt that has come up through it… At a farm on Far North Queensland's Atherton Tablelands, these people are behaving in a rather strange way. They are searching through piles of cattle dung and looking for a little animal that has one of the most unappealing and yet important jobs in the world; eating animal droppings. Dr Bernard Doube is the world's leading ecologist specialising in studying this small and misunderstood creature. This is a beetle that comes from the high rainfall districts of eastern Africa and we introduced it about 30 years ago and it's got a very restricted distribution up here on the Atherton and hardly anywhere else in Australia. But up here it's doing a great job. It digs a tunnel to about 20 centimetres, something like that, lines the tunnel with dung and so the earthworms that are here, they go down feeding on the dung that's lining the tunnel, and then down below the beetle puts perhaps half a litre of dung, something like that, a huge amount really, and lays a whole lot of eggs in it, the eggs hatch into larvae, the larvae then eat all of the dung, the adult beetles feed on the dung juices and the larvae feed on the dung fibre. And so then the larvae crap out this processed stuff, which is rather like compost. And so down at 20 centimetres you've now got earthworm casts and down below you've got a great big pile of plant nutrients ready, and so the roots grow down there, and so you get increased production and increased carbon storage because it's a relatively permanent change in the structure of the soil. So the dung beetles are of great benefit in terms of increasing the permeability of the soil to moisture. But up here the water goes straight in. So the primary benefits are to get the dung underground, stop pasture fouling, and also then to increase the subsoil fertility of the region, and so this will last us quite some years, and so over time the whole pasture will be processed by dung beetle activity, and our experiments from southern Australia indicate that we get about a 30% increase in productivity due to the dung burial activity of the beetles. Dr Bernard Doube on Country Breakfast , RN. And so to a newcomer. CSIRO in Canberra are importing a fresh visitor, and Dr Valerie Caron is in charge of this servant of Sisyphus. My first question is this; we've got about 500 native dung beetles in Australia, they've been here for squillions of years, why do we need to import more, as we did some time ago? You are right, we have amazing dung beetles that are native to Australia and we do have 500 species. The only issue with these amazing creatures is that they coevolved with native fauna, they have coevolved with them. So they are very much used to that kind of dung, kind of dry, fibrous dung produced by kangaroos and wombats and all that. So when Europeans brought those cows and sheep, they produce a lot of dung, those beetles could not deal with it, so they could not use that dung and it just accumulated on the soil surface and that has a lot of negative impact. So that's why we bring dung beetles from other countries, so we bring dung beetles that can deal with that cattle and sheep dung. And how many have been brought so far? So we are at 44 species now, so that's quite a lot of species but that's in over 60 years, it's a very long program. So during this program that we are doing now, we are bringing three new ones. From Morocco. Yes, they are coming from Morocco, for various reasons. So we are trying to really focus on southern Australia and spring dung beetles that we are looking for. So Morocco has an amazing diversity of dung beetles, they have a lot of cattle, they have a lot of herds, they have a very high population of dung beetles compared to other countries. I thought for one minute you were going to talk about how we need to have dung beetles for camel dung. We have camels too! Actually, camels are an invasive species in Australia and they produce a copious amount of dung, but we are not focusing on that at the moment. Morocco has a very diverse climate, which is very interesting because they do have mountains, they are bordered by sea, bordered by desert on the other side, so they have very varied climate, which is actually quite useful for us when we are looking for dung beetles that would thrive in Australia. And what sort of dung are they after when you let them loose? Cattle and sheep mostly. The area where we go in Morocco, it's where there are big herds of cows and mostly sheep and goats, and there is always a donkey. Yes, sure, always a donkey, but surely to cover that we've already got various imported dung beetles, even for South Australia, to look after that problem. What need is there for these new ones? So we do have 44 species that were introduced, 23 have established, so they are doing a great job. But each dung beetle has an activity window, they are not active all year round, and what we want is dung beetles that actually…when they're active and they take the dung down to the soil. So we don't want the dung to stay on the surface. So those species of beetles are great, but there are still some gaps. So we've got gaps in season and we have geographical gaps as well. What we are focusing on now is on the gap in spring that is all over southern Australia, so we are talking about WA all the way to Tasmania and New South Wales. So we are really covering a large area. So in early spring there are not enough dung beetles doing the job, and then the dung just accumulates on the soil surface and it causes a lot of different problems, it spoils pasture, accumulation of dung, if there is a flood it will go in the waterways and then can cause water pollution. And also one of the main things I think that all Australians care about is the bush flies that are very annoying, they actually spread and grow in dung. So if you have a lot of dung on a surface, you provide a lot of habitat for those flies to thrive and then you can get these crazy populations of flies. They are just very annoying, they don't bite but they are still really, really difficult to deal with. Yes, that was the main reason, way back in the beginning, that an awful lot of people…the corks on your brimmed hat weren't enough to keep them away and so people just got terribly fed up…and this brilliant idea. But tell me, when these dung beetles…we've all seen films of them, a bit like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the mountain forever, they of course are rolling, these dung beetles, this beautiful work of the round pieces of dung which they're pushing towards presumably their burrows. Yes, so it's interesting because we always think about the dung beetle that rolls the ball, in fact at the moment we only have two species that are established that are rollers, all the other ones are tunnellers. So what they do is they make little tunnels under the dung pad and then they will take the dung down, make a little ball, and that's where they actually lay their eggs, so they need to take out that dung to provide resources for their developing larvae. So the roller, we only have two species, we just imported a new one that actually is a roller as well, they are amazing and we see them even climbing walls of cages. They are actually really good at rolling that ball if they really want to go. You really love these creatures, don't you, and the dung, you're a coprologist. Well, let's say I'm working on the beetles than the actual dung, but they are really fascinating creatures, and what I find the most interesting is that each species has their own little quirks and their own behaviour and they are all quite different, and that, as a scientist, is the most fascinating thing. Have you done much, by the way…the problem that most people have in science who are importing new species is to make sure that they don't disturb the ecology when they turn up in surprising ways. Yes, that's actually one of the main things that we have to do and we are very, very careful with that, so it's very hard to introduce anything in Australia and we should be very proud of our biosecurity policies and all the people that keep our borders safe, actually. So when we introduced dung beetles it was a very long process for people to actually accept dung beetles to be imported, so we have a special permit for that. There was a big risk assessment that was done as well by the Department of Environment then. And also when we bring dung beetles in we bring adults, so they are collected from the field in Morocco, they are then cleaned, identified, starved, sent to a laboratory in France because we have CSIRO's laboratory in southern France. Then they are again fed maybe for a little while but they will be cleaned again. We have to remove any little organism that could be on them because little things hitchhike on dung beetles, little mites for example. And then they will be cleaned again, starved and then sent to Australia. They will only be kept in a quarantine facility, which is actually at Black Mountain. We receive the adults, we again clean them just to make sure they are fine, we feed them because they are very hungry by that stage, and that's where we breed them. But the only thing we can take out of quarantine are their eggs, and the eggs have been surface-sterilised, so there is absolutely nasty that can come out. So the eggs are squeaky-clean, no viruses, no nematodes, nothing that can be on them, then we take them out and then we can rear them, which is incredible that it's working really because it's a very harsh chemical we are using on them. Very reassuring. By the way, you mentioned mites, of course we are terribly worried about mites at the moment in regard to bees, aren't we. Yes, so a different type of mites, there is such a diversity of mites in the world. Dung is actually an ecosystem, there are so many things living in dung, which I find really impressive, but yes, there are little mites that will be in the dung, and what they do is that they actually hitchhike on the dung beetles. So when they want to move pad, instead of moving themselves, they are little, they can't fly, they will just hop on the dung beetle and then the dung beetle will take them somewhere else. So we make sure we don't bring those in the country, and even if they were coming to quarantine, they can't come out of quarantine anyway, so it's very, very safe. So, very different from the varroa mite, it's a very big problem on bees. Very reassuring, given the precautions that you mentioned. My final question to you, you come from Canada, from Québec, how is it that you are transferred to such an Australian measure? I can imagine it's a bit too snowy and icy in parts of Canada to have dung beetles, the poor things. But thank you so much, Valerie. Thank you so much.

"So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered the story of a man who was hospitalised with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps, increased thirst, and he had also lost close to 13 kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and it was vitamin D overdose, was it? Yes, vitamin D supplements, he had been taking way too many of them. And I don't know if it's just me but it feels like everywhere that I look I'm seeing other people ODing on vitamin. There was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D, there were women who have accidentally taken so much vitamin B6 that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at ABC Melbourne. Yes, if a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Exactly. So we're going to take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr Ian Musgrave who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi Ian. Hello, how are you? Good. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell. Vitamin overdose is certainly a thing but it seems to come in waves. For example, a lot of the vitamin D overdosing is occurring because people have thought that it might be a good way to prevent Covid. Sadly, tragically it's virtually useless as a preventative for Covid. One of the problems with the B6 is that, as your colleague has said, we all know that vitamins are important for us, we all know that we need vitamins for health, but we think that because a little bit is good for us, a lot maybe is better. And sadly, tragically with vitamins, this isn't true. And also what people don't realise is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what has happened with one person, for example, is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained B6, and it all added up so they ended up with B6 toxicity. It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realising. Yes, indeed. Unless you pay very close attention to what you're taking, you may not understand that there is enough vitamin B in everything you are taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects, especially the water-soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as having potentially toxic effects. But, for example, B6 is one where it's relatively easy to get up to a dose which can cause nerve damage. So we don't necessarily see it as being toxic per se, but if you were taking more than 300, 500 milligrams of B6 over time, it can cause nerve damage. It's something that's not really widely known because until the advent of high potency vitamin supplements, the chances of getting a B6 overdose were marginal. Yes, you weren't going to see it just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? If it's possible to get these sorts of effects, do people need to be better informed by…presumably a lot of the time you are buying them from a pharmacist or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a naturopath or something like that. Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well, they are regulated like medicines in Australia, but having said that I would like to point out that within Australia medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and they are regulated on two levels. You have low risk medicines, like vitamins, which are regulated by the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods where you don't need to require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it because they are assuming that you will read the instructions on the box and take them accordingly. And the registered medicines, which are things like, for example, paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence of them working but also strong evidence about their safety. The upshot is read those labels. Yes, and if it doesn't have an AUSTL or AUSSTAR number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much Dr Ian Musgrave for joining us. Thank you.

"Thanks Robyn. Yes, after two years of online events, the big get-together of high achievers in science was certainly happening this week, with a full-on celebration at the Australian Museum in Sydney. It was party gear and glamour and music pumping as guests arrived, with the museum feeling more like a nightclub. This year marks the 32nd year for the Eurekas, established in 1990 when you, Robyn, were president. MC Bernie Hobbs led us through the awards with her trademark style, combining irreverence and fun. She didn't hold back when a conga line of highly doctored winners messed up finding their way onto the stage. Now, what is it with professors that they don't know how to follow simple instructions. Up by the stairs. Too many qualifications, that's your problem, use the stairs people…well done… So let's run through some of the winners and, importantly, the work which led to their awards. The Eureka Prize for Innovative Use of Technology went to a group from La Trobe Uni, University of Melbourne, the Garvan and Peter MacCallum Institutes, who've developed NanoMslide, a coating which allows the simple glass microscope to detect early-stage cancer cells. The sample interacts with the coating and changes colour. Fast, accurate and cheap diagnosis without specialised equipment. The Eureka Prize for Outstanding Early Career Scientist went to Tess Reynolds at the University of Sydney. Tess has developed technology to better guide robotic imaging during surgery, offering much better images for cardiac and spinal surgery. The Prize for Interdisciplinary Research went to a large group which looked at what drives what we eat and the effects on the environment. Their computers looked at billions of links between producers and consumers, and their results are used by the United Nations and other international bodies. The Leadership Prize went to Raina MacIntyre, whose work has been used internationally in the Covid response. The Eureka Prize for Mentorship went to Paul Wood who developed IMNIS, that's Industry Mentoring and Networking in STEM, where over 1,700 alumni are standing by to help PhD graduates and early-career researchers. And for science journalism, Ryan Jackson's online piece for CNET, 'Journey to the Ice Kingdom', saw him a winner. He was on the research vessel Nuyina for a trip to Antarctica. We were reminded many times during the evening that there are marvellous videos from winners and finalists on the Australian Museum website for the Eureka Prizes. The emotional highlight for me was the Eureka Prize for Scientific Research, awarded to Justin Yerbury. In 2016, Professor Yerbury was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, a degenerative disease with no known cure. He leads a team at the University of Wollongong that has challenged the prevailing thought about the pathology of MND. To receive his award, Professor Yerbury was assisted onto stage in his wheelchair and spoke using a text-to-speech program. I have too many people that I would like to thank, so I cannot name them all. Nothing would be possible without my wife Rachel, not even life itself. My daughters Talia and Maddie, family and friends have also been great supporters of my work. I also have to thank my amazing research team and some close-knit collaborators that have all gone above and beyond what would normally be expected of them. The University of Wollongong and IHMRI have been tremendous supporters of me and my work. They have actively removed all barriers for me to keep working. I would like to thank the people of Wollongong and people all across the country that have been great supporters of our work, ranging from letters of encouragement to substantial donations. Thank you very much and congratulations again, Professor Yerbury. The thing about science awards is that they bring hope, not only from the amazing discoveries and achievements but also from seeing the scientists of tomorrow. Sleek Geek secondary school entrants were challenged to make a two-minute video about change. The winner wasn't from year 12 or year 11 but a year seven student. So the winner of the 2022 Sleek Geek Science Eureka Prize for Secondary School is Iestyn Rush. [Excerpt from Neuroplasticity - You Can Change Your Brain ] Part of a two-minute summary of first-year neurobiology. Maybe Iestyn will skip high school and go straight to uni. Thank you very much, this is an absolute surprise. I get to live my dream each and every day but the most important thing is I get to share and excite people, and to me I guess the thing that gives me hope and optimism for the future is the fact that there are all these incredibly brilliant young people who love science and communicate science. These kids are inspiring. I want to thank the University of New South Wales and everyone who has been such a fabulous supporter, our team at the University SMART Centre and I want to say thank you so much for all those incredible partners in our local councils, in our communities, in businesses who actually want to see and shape a sustainable future, and this is why we do science. Thank you. Thank you so much Veena. Yes, Veena Sahajwalla, awarded the Eureka Prize for Promoting the Understanding of Science. Veena makes waste a resource, green steel, where in place of coal, old car tyres are the carbon source for steel making, and the e-waste micro-factory, recovering precious metals from electronic circuit boards, always described with infectious enthusiasm.

"Food labelling and the amount of added sugar in foods is a hot topic at the moment. Food Standards Australian and New Zealand are currently looking at ways to help people choose lower sugar foods. But a study released on Friday has had a counterintuitive finding, that putting warning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them. Well, to talk us through the findings and what they could mean is one of its authors, Miranda Blake. Welcome Miranda. Thank you for having me, Tegan. So you did an online survey asking people whether they'd buy things like breakfast cereal, yoghurt and non-alcoholic drinks while testing out different styles of sugar warning labels. Were you surprised by the results? Yes, we were, we expected to find that these would affect the likelihood of selecting a high sugar product, and we didn't find that. But systematic reviews with consumers have found that clearer labelling of added sugar on packaged foods does help consumers to pick lower sugar options. So I would say more research is needed. But we also did find that consumers strongly supported clear labelling of added sugar on packaging, so this suggests that if these labels were introduced there would be strong consumer support for that policy. Right, so people weren't…like, they were keen on them but what you're finding didn't really fit with previous findings. What could the disconnect be there? There is always the probability of just random chance in research. I think also we found that consumers are strongly supportive of having that information so that they could make an informed decision. So while we…again, the research does suggest that providing this information could help consumers to make healthier choices, I think the bottom line is also that consumers deserve to have the information to make that informed decision for themselves. Right, because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in a product. That's correct. So in Australia, manufacturers of packaged foods often add sugar to products, like breakfast cereals, yoghurts and drinks, but there is currently no way for Australians to know how much added sugar is in a packaged food, so that's why we tested these seven different labelling options to see if any of them had an impact on the likelihood of selecting a high sugar option. Right, so that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered, despite the overarching outcome of your study. Are there other reasons as well? Yes, so we know that in order to have any other policies around added sugar, so, for example, if we did education campaigns around added sugar or we restricted the marketing of products high in added sugar, we need to know how much added sugar is in products. So it's both important for providing information directly to consumers but also to support other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or, more broadly, to support consumers to select products that are lower in added sugar. Is this going to be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that warning labels should be on packaging? I hope not because I hope that they can see that, again, we had 85% of consumers who agreed that we need to set higher standards for how the food industry labels the foods we eat. And again, the broader evidence does suggest that this probably does help consumers to select healthier options. So, if we do introduce added sugar labelling policies, which the government is currently considering, that policy would need to be paired with an education campaign for consumers, particularly those with lower levels of literacy and numeracy, support them in how to use that information so that they can pick those products that are lower in added sugar. So how does this fit against other things that are on the table, for example, with sugar tax, and whether the new government might be heading in that direction or not? Well, it would be great to see if the Labor government would commit to an added sugar tax, either in food or drinks, preferably both, but I think what we can see is that, again, we need to be able to know how much added sugar is in food before we can introduce any policies. This is a really important step in supporting broader policies to support consumers to eat products that are lower in added sugar that are better for their well-being. How do these sorts of interventions interact with each other if you've got more than one thing happening at once? You've just measured one thing in this study but that's not really how it's going to work in the real world, just briefly. That's right, so we know from the example of tobacco regulation, for example, we saw…you know, over many years more and more policies were put into place, and these can work together, so they can be greater than the sum of their parts. So, added sugar labelling on its own may be made much more effective, for example, by having education campaigns around sugar content and a tax around added sugar as well, so they can work together to support healthy consumer choices. It's one that we are watching closely. Miranda, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks very much for having me.
