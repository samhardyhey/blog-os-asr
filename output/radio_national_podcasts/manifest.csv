"Hello and welcome to this week's Health Report with me, Norman Swan. And me, Tegan Taylor. Today, your genes and how you go with COVID-19. But have they found a genetic explanation for why some people don't seem to catch the disease? Do warning labels on sugary foods work? How not to overdose on vitamin supplements. And, which diet is best at preventing cancer? And, if you've been diagnosed with cancer, which is more likely to improve your outcome? A wholefood, plant-based diet, or a low-carb ketogenic diet? Dr Neil Iyengar of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York has recently published an extensive review of the evidence. Thank you for having me. I mean, this diet debate goes back ages. I can remember a time when extremely low-fat diets were tested in cancer prevention and indeed improved cancer outcomes. You've focused in this study on a wholefood, plant-based diet and a ketogenic diet. Let's just get the definitions right. What are we talking about in terms of these diets? That is a great question because particularly with the plant-based diets and even the ketogenic diet there's a lot of variation. If we start with the plant-based diet, I generally consider a plant-based diet to be one in which 80% to 90% of the nutritional intake essentially comes from plant sources. And to go one step further, we were particularly interested in wholefood plant-based diets, and this is essentially where we would further define that 80% to 90% as minimally processed or minimally altered plant-based products as the major component of the diet, leaving a little bit of wiggle room for non-plant-based products and that's where we differentiate a plant-based diet from, say, a full-on vegetarian diet or a full-on vegan diet. And when you say on manipulated, you're talking about…it's not a protein ball, it's what Michael Pollan the food writer would say is food that your grandmother would recognise as food. Yes, exactly, this is foods from the garden, if you will, that are minimally altered, cooked in your kitchen, and put on your plate. Okay, let's go to the keto diet because, again, there's lots of confusion here because people are on low carbs, they are on 5:2 diets, they're on time restricted diets. Right, and so when we are talking about a ketogenic diet, at least in the context of this research, we are essentially talking about diets whereby the body is forced to use a different type of fuel, ketone bodies, hence the name of the diet. The way in which a person achieves ketosis is important but may be more variable based on the individual. The more common way to define a ketogenic diet is actually the macronutrient ratio, so the ratios of carbohydrates to proteins to fat. And the majority of ketogenic diets are essentially high in protein and low in carbohydrate, and that's because we are replacing the carbohydrate with protein. When we say low in carbohydrate, we mean very low, generally less than 30 to 40 grams of carbohydrates a day. Let's start with the epidemiological evidence, looking at what trials have been done and also the broad patterns in the population. What do we know about these two diets on a broad front when you look at the population evidence, before we get to the biochemistry and what they do to your body. The vast majority of population or observational evidence is actually regarding plant-based diets. We have several large cohort studies which have looked at the relationship between consumption of mostly plant-based foods and the incidence or the occurrence of various cancers, and what we see there are strong associations that have been found repeatedly across many different studies, many different populations in many different geographic regions, a strong association between higher consumption of plant-based products and lower incidence of several different cancers, predominantly cancers that are related to metabolism, like insulin levels, inflammation, and so these tend to be breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and so forth. At least 13 different cancers are metabolically mediated and have a lower incidence in populations that report higher intake of plant-based foods. And the ketogenic diet? So the ketogenic diet in terms of the observational data is less robust, and this is where we get into difficulties with regard to definitions of the ketogenic diet. Generally speaking we see studies that have categorised diets as low carbohydrate diets. Low carbohydrate diets have been associated with a lowering of risk of some cancers, although the associations are not as strong as what we see in the plant-based diets. But when we really dive down to ketogenic diets, there are very few studies that cleanly look at the relationship in large populations between those who consume ketogenic diet and the incidence of cancer, and the results of those studies are mixed. Some studies have found a protective effect or a protective association I should say, with the ketogenic diet and a few cancers. Now, those studies are a bit problematic because it is difficult to tease out whether it truly was the ketosis or whether or not it was weight loss or other factors that that are achieved with a ketogenic diet that may also be achieved with a plant-based diet. So let's dig down and compare, if you like, the biochemistry, what these diets do in your body, and of course the word on everybody's lips or tongue I should say is microbiome. When you put these side-by-side in terms of a wholefood, plant-based diet and ketogenic diet, what did you find? Well, there's far more data with plant-based diets than there are with ketogenic diets. What we did find was that individuals or populations that consume plant-based diets seem to have far more favourable changes in their gut microbiome than those who consumed ketogenic diets. There are some studies that suggest that the diversity of the gut microbiome may actually decrease with ketogenic diets, and that's likely related to more singular sources of protein, namely animal. You also looked at where you lose your weight from when you are on these two diets, and your suggestion is that on the ketogenic diet you lose more muscle. Yes, one of the things that we are very concerned about is body composition. Individuals with advanced cancer can have wasting syndromes or cachexia where they have a very low volume of muscle. And we also know that muscle can be protective against the development of cancer. One of the things we were interested in in our review of the available data was whether or not these diets differentially impacted body composition. And we did generally see for those who were using either diet, the plant-based diet or the ketogenic diet, for weight loss purposes, we did see that those who consumed plant-based diets were more likely to lose higher amounts of fat compared to muscle, whereas individuals consuming a ketogenic diet with the goal of weight loss had either an equal loss of fat and muscle or sometimes a greater loss of muscle than fact, which was particularly concerning as we know that muscle is protective against the development of cancer. Half the world seems to be on either a 5:2 diet, in other words five days of fairly free eating, two days maybe on 500 calories each which are ketogenic days, or time restricted eating where you don't eat anything from maybe 8 o'clock in the evening until about 1- or 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Have any of those being tested in terms of cancer prevention or the effects on the body that might lead to cancer prevention? There is great interest in time mediated feeding and fasting. It turns out that fasting has positive impacts on insulin levels which of course is a protective effect against cancer. However, individuals who follow an intermittent fasting type diet after achieving a healthy body weight, for example, may actually be exposing themselves to a higher risk of losing muscle mass, and from a cancer perspective, again, that is very concerning. One of the first questions that any cancer specialist gets from someone with cancer after they've got over the shock of the diagnosis is, 'How should I change my diet, Doctor, to benefit myself?' Did you come to any sort of answer there? Because clearly if diets change your metabolism, diets can affect how your cancer progresses and it might even interfere or enhance the drugs you are giving. What did you discover about that? This is such an important question and I think that historically we as oncologists have really not paid enough attention to this question, even though patients are asking us this question, as you pointed out. My strong recommendation is to follow a plant-based diet. But I will make one major caveat to that and that is that there are certainly very specific types of cancer where the ketogenic diet may actually be beneficial, and we are studying about in randomised controlled trials. But by far for most cancers the plant-based diet carries the most cancer protective effects. And which cancers are they that may have a ketogenic benefit? Well, there are certain tumours that are highly dependent on insulin or that are treated with medications that drive up insulin levels. And while a plant-based diet can be very successful at lowering those insulin levels, there are actually studies in mice which suggests that for tumours which have a specific type of genetic mutation called a PI3-kinase mutation, specifically breast tumours with PI3-kinase mutations that are treated with PI3-kinase inhibitors, the ketogenic diet may be beneficial for improving the efficacy of that cancer treatment. That needs to be proven in humans and we have an ongoing study that is testing that question. But there are other PI3-kinase mutated cancers, like certain blood cancers or leukaemias, where the ketogenic diet may actually have the opposite effect and be harmful. So before we go recommending the ketogenic diet for every person with that kind of cancer, a PI3-kinase mutated cancer, we really need to wait for the human diet, and in the meantime the plant-based diet still appears to be protective for those types of cancers. So, the bottom line, Neil, is whether you've got cancer or you are trying to prevent it, bias yourself towards a wholefood, plant-based diet, watch how you lose your weight so that you maintain muscle mass, and retain ketogenic diets, at least at the moment, for highly specific situations. That is exactly what I would conclude from our current state of the evidence. Thank you very much for joining us on the Health Report. My pleasure, thank you for having me. Neil Iyengar is a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York. And this is the Health Report. So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered the story of a man who was hospitalised with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps, increased thirst, and he had also lost close to 13 kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and it was vitamin D overdose, was it? Yes, vitamin D supplements, he had been taking way too many of them. And I don't know if it's just me but it feels like everywhere that I look I'm seeing other people ODing on vitamin. There was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D, there were women who have accidentally taken so much vitamin B6 that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at ABC Melbourne. Yes, if a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Exactly. So we're going to take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr Ian Musgrave who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi Ian. Hello, how are you? Good. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell. Vitamin overdose is certainly a thing but it seems to come in waves. For example, a lot of the vitamin D overdosing is occurring because people have thought that it might be a good way to prevent Covid. Sadly, tragically it's virtually useless as a preventative for Covid. One of the problems with the B6 is that, as your colleague has said, we all know that vitamins are important for us, we all know that we need vitamins for health, but we think that because a little bit is good for us, a lot maybe is better. And sadly, tragically with vitamins, this isn't true. And also what people don't realise is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what has happened with one person, for example, is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained B6, and it all added up so they ended up with B6 toxicity. It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realising. Yes, indeed. Unless you pay very close attention to what you're taking, you may not understand that there is enough vitamin B in everything you are taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects, especially the water-soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as having potentially toxic effects. But, for example, B6 is one where it's relatively easy to get up to a dose which can cause nerve damage. So we don't necessarily see it as being toxic per se, but if you were taking more than 300, 500 milligrams of B6 over time, it can cause nerve damage. It's something that's not really widely known because until the advent of high potency vitamin supplements, the chances of getting a B6 overdose were marginal. Yes, you weren't going to see it just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? If it's possible to get these sorts of effects, do people need to be better informed by…presumably a lot of the time you are buying them from a pharmacist or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a naturopath or something like that. Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well, they are regulated like medicines in Australia, but having said that I would like to point out that within Australia medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and they are regulated on two levels. You have low risk medicines, like vitamins, which are regulated by the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods where you don't need to require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it because they are assuming that you will read the instructions on the box and take them accordingly. And the registered medicines, which are things like, for example, paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence of them working but also strong evidence about their safety. The upshot is read those labels. Yes, and if it doesn't have an AUSTL or AUSSTAR number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much Dr Ian Musgrave for joining us. Thank you. Dr Ian Musgrave is a molecular pharmacologist and toxicologist at the University of Adelaide. Food labelling and the amount of added sugar in foods is a hot topic at the moment. Food Standards Australian and New Zealand are currently looking at ways to help people choose lower sugar foods. But a study released on Friday has had a counterintuitive finding, that putting warning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them. Well, to talk us through the findings and what they could mean is one of its authors, Miranda Blake. Welcome Miranda. Thank you for having me, Tegan. So you did an online survey asking people whether they'd buy things like breakfast cereal, yoghurt and non-alcoholic drinks while testing out different styles of sugar warning labels. Were you surprised by the results? Yes, we were, we expected to find that these would affect the likelihood of selecting a high sugar product, and we didn't find that. But systematic reviews with consumers have found that clearer labelling of added sugar on packaged foods does help consumers to pick lower sugar options. So I would say more research is needed. But we also did find that consumers strongly supported clear labelling of added sugar on packaging, so this suggests that if these labels were introduced there would be strong consumer support for that policy. Right, so people weren't…like, they were keen on them but what you're finding didn't really fit with previous findings. What could the disconnect be there? There is always the probability of just random chance in research. I think also we found that consumers are strongly supportive of having that information so that they could make an informed decision. So while we…again, the research does suggest that providing this information could help consumers to make healthier choices, I think the bottom line is also that consumers deserve to have the information to make that informed decision for themselves. Right, because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in a product. That's correct. So in Australia, manufacturers of packaged foods often add sugar to products, like breakfast cereals, yoghurts and drinks, but there is currently no way for Australians to know how much added sugar is in a packaged food, so that's why we tested these seven different labelling options to see if any of them had an impact on the likelihood of selecting a high sugar option. Right, so that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered, despite the overarching outcome of your study. Are there other reasons as well? Yes, so we know that in order to have any other policies around added sugar, so, for example, if we did education campaigns around added sugar or we restricted the marketing of products high in added sugar, we need to know how much added sugar is in products. So it's both important for providing information directly to consumers but also to support other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or, more broadly, to support consumers to select products that are lower in added sugar. Is this going to be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that warning labels should be on packaging? I hope not because I hope that they can see that, again, we had 85% of consumers who agreed that we need to set higher standards for how the food industry labels the foods we eat. And again, the broader evidence does suggest that this probably does help consumers to select healthier options. So, if we do introduce added sugar labelling policies, which the government is currently considering, that policy would need to be paired with an education campaign for consumers, particularly those with lower levels of literacy and numeracy, support them in how to use that information so that they can pick those products that are lower in added sugar. So how does this fit against other things that are on the table, for example, with sugar tax, and whether the new government might be heading in that direction or not? Well, it would be great to see if the Labor government would commit to an added sugar tax, either in food or drinks, preferably both, but I think what we can see is that, again, we need to be able to know how much added sugar is in food before we can introduce any policies. This is a really important step in supporting broader policies to support consumers to eat products that are lower in added sugar that are better for their well-being. How do these sorts of interventions interact with each other if you've got more than one thing happening at once? You've just measured one thing in this study but that's not really how it's going to work in the real world, just briefly. That's right, so we know from the example of tobacco regulation, for example, we saw…you know, over many years more and more policies were put into place, and these can work together, so they can be greater than the sum of their parts. So, added sugar labelling on its own may be made much more effective, for example, by having education campaigns around sugar content and a tax around added sugar as well, so they can work together to support healthy consumer choices. It's one that we are watching closely. Miranda, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks very much for having me. Dr Miranda Blake is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Global Centre for Preventative Health and Nutrition, and the Institute for Health Transformation at Deakin University. One of the common questions that Tegan and I get about Covid is why there's so much variation in how people respond to the infection. One answer is in your genes, and there is a massive ongoing study into comparing people's genomes with how COVID-19 has affected them. Dr Gita Pathak is a team leader in what's called the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Gita is based at Yale University's School of Medicine in the United States. Thank you for inviting me, I really appreciate it. So you're not mapping the virus here, you're mapping the people who were infected with the virus to see what happens to them and whether there are specific genes involved in their experience of the virus. That is correct. The goal of the study is to understand human genetics response to the viral infection which we know as COVID-19. We wanted to look at three different outcomes of COVID-19, specifically people who were critically ill from Covid, then people who were hospitalised due to Covid, and people who tested positive for Covid, so the least severe of the three definitions, and which genes might be associated with these three outcomes. And how many genomes have you managed to test? 60 studies from 25 countries, and that resulted in close to 3 million individuals' genetic profiles, and we found a total of 23 genes that show an association with COVID-19. So, let's take severity, and this is in a European population, by and large, a Caucasian population. Have you found any consistency in genes for severe disease? Yes, so genetic ancestry is different than what someone may identify themselves as, like ethnically or geographically. Mostly we do have genetic ancestry of the European descent, but we also had people who are genetically South Asian, East Asian, African ancestry, and that separate from where they are geographically or what they identify as. So this is a bit like 23andMe or Ancestry.com where you send off your genes and you find out that you are 50% Greek and you didn't think you were 50% Greek. Correct. When we are looking at genetic profiles, it's really important to adjust for genetic ancestry and not specifically for what somebody identifies as. Some genetic variation is more common in one ancestry over others, and if we include people from these diverse ancestries, we can pick up these signals much more quickly… So, for example, it was said in the early part of the pandemic that people of South Asian origin had more severe disease and a higher risk of death. Did that pan out in your study? We did find one of the genetic variants that was more common in South Asian populations relative to other populations, but that is just one variant. Genes tend to perform in a similar way across ancestries. They may vary based on their frequency in different ancestries, and that information helps us capture why one ancestry might be exhibiting a higher response or a softer response, but by and large all the genes we saw, they tend to have a similar effect across all ancestries. And what with these genes doing to increase your vulnerability to severe disease? Some of the genes that we found were related to different lung functions. So, for example, we found something called SFTPD which is a lung surfactant protein, and it has already been known to be associated with different pulmonary functions, and there are other studies which have shown that this specific gene has been known with respiratory distress syndrome in different populations. And just to explain, surfactant is the fluid, if you like, that lines the tubes of your lungs and keeps them open, and it's what is deficient in premature babies, causing the respiratory disease of the premature baby. So, in other words, a deficiency of this in adults may predispose you, unsurprisingly, to severe disease. The question of course on everybody's lips now is why do some people not seem to catch COVID-19? There's a group of people who appear anecdotally to be resistant. Did you find COVID-19 resistance genes? Not in our work. Depending on how we look at the variant, the varients we find are associated with the COVID-19 outcome, but if there are people who may be on the opposite spectrum of these, so let's say who are not carriers of this, they might be generally resistant to Covid but that specific study we haven't performed, but that's a good question for later. And just finally, any therapeutic insights that might direct people towards more effective medications to treat people who've got Covid, or prevent it getting worse? One good thing that we understand from this work is that we now have a good number of genes to specifically focus our efforts into, and now this can lead to efforts of drug repurposing or drug development. Did we find a specific drug? No, but we definitely found several targets that now could be investigated for different drugs. Gita, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me, I really appreciate it. Dr Gita Pathak is a team leader in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative at Yale University's School of Medicine. This has been the Health Report from me, Norman Swan. And me, Tegan Taylor. And we'll both see you next week. See you then.",1715.744,28.59573333333333,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/29-august-health-report.mp3,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/29-august-health-report.txt,29-august-health-report,4424,154.70839472555346
"So I worked at this advertising creative agency and they did this annual award ceremony where they award people for funny things or silly things, and I was sitting in the audience, obviously not wanting attention but waiting for my award because I had worked really hard at this job, I had stayed up late, I'd given so much to it. And at the end of the ceremony they finally started announcing this award and it was for the person who gave their life over to it and stayed really late and had no life because they worked so much and it was the Midnight Oil Award, and they thought it was this huge compliment. And I was so offended and so hurt by it because I wanted to be noticed for creativity or my ideas or things like that. You don't want to be rewarded just for staying late at work, it's really embarrassing. And that was one of the things that tipped me off the edge really. This is dubious award-winner Jessica Pan. When this all went down, she was in her early 30s, wondering what had happened to her journalism career, and feeling deeply lonely. The Midnight Oil Award was the final indignity, and it sparked a year-long quest to see if she could change a key aspect of her personality, one she felt was responsible for so many of her troubles. You see, Jessica was a lifelong introvert, actually a 'shintrovert'. So 'shintrovert' is a word I made up, it's not technical, and it just stands for 'shy introvert'. Basically, introversion is a spectrum and there are introverts who enjoy public speaking, but they need to be alone to recharge after a party. And then there are introverts who also need to be alone to recharge but who would be absolutely terrified to give a speech because they are also shy. And for the most part Jessica was fine with her 'shintroversion', until the loneliness crept in. I just sort of hit this rock-bottom moment where I thought, am I using this label of introvert to say no to absolutely anything that gives me anxiety? And what would happen if I finally let go of that and just sort of did all the things that scared me? What would happen? You're listening to All in the Mind, I'm Sana Qadar, and today we've got part one of a two-parter on introversion vs extroversion, the benefits and downsides of each, how these traits can impact our mental health, and whether we can change, if we want to. Next week we'll take a deeper look at the science of personality, but today, part one, Jessica's journey. Can an introvert learn to become more extroverted? And why making friends after your 20s is so painful. Jessica's loneliness crept up on her, as her life changed in ways it inevitably does as you get older. I think it was two different things, which is that I became a freelancer and I was working from home, and you just start feeling quite lonely and you sort of watch the world go by and you don't really feel a part of it if you are the kind of person I am. And also I had reached that age where I was in my early 30s, and so many of my friends had left the city and were having kids or had returned home, or they were just…I just felt like I didn't have any close friends left where I was in this big, massive city of London. And it feels quite lonely when you're in this really big, bustling city and you don't actually feel like you have that many connexions. And being shy does not help when you're in that kind of situation. But this is who Jessica was, this is who she'd always been. I was a really shy, kid, I hated…you know, my mom would throw me these big birthday parties and she never understood why I absolutely hated them. And I didn't know how to explain to her that I didn't like all this attention. I hated giving speeches at school and presentations, I would fake sick, I really…yeah, always, my whole life. Yeah right, and so as you got older, how did this manifest in your life? Like, what would you do or not do in social situations? I just would never go networking. The idea of walking into a room full of strangers and talking to them terrified me. At work I would never want to give a presentation or volunteer for these things. I felt like I was like giving myself my own glass ceiling. In meetings I didn't want to speak. Yes, I felt like it was something I lived with, but then sort of reached this pinnacle of I guess lowness, about where sort of the book begins. That book is her first, called Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come The short definition is if two people go to a party and one leaves feeling really recharged and energised and one leaves feeling kind of exhausted, the one who is exhausted is the introvert. And so by definition, introverts, they relish solitude, they don't like small talk, they love one-on-one conversations. In general, they avoid public speaking, although definitely there are introverts who enjoy it and love it. They seem to be more sensitive, they're really good at concentrating on tasks really well. You might remember there was also a popular TED Talk a about a decade ago by writer Susan Cain that laid out the many advantages of introversion, it was called 'The Power of Introverts'. …even though introverts get better grades and are more knowledgeable , according to research! I was aware of Susan Cain's book, Quiet, which I quote a lot in the book. But I felt like that book was an amazing resource, but I still felt like Susan Cain was a shy introvert, she hates giving speeches and she knew that she had to put herself on stage, do that TED Talk. If she wanted to put this message out to millions of people, she had to challenge herself as well. And I really wanted to just sort of see someone else do all of these scary things. And I actually literally was looking for that book and was like, oh my God, that book doesn't exist, that's so weird to me. And so that's kind of a small reason why I wanted to do this as well. So the very first 'scary' experiment that Jessica threw herself into was actually one of her nightmares; talking to strangers. Or trying to anyway. To help her get started, she consulted with clinical psychologist Professor Stefan Hofmann from Boston University. So, Stefan Hofmann helps people get over their anxiety. And his research found that the best way to do this is through exposure therapy. So, if one of his patients had social anxiety, he would advise them to go out on the street and start singing in public or to spill coffee all over themselves in public again and again. Or to ask people on the train for $400. You know, your basic nightmares where you are almost guaranteed to be totally rejected. And the point of this is to realise that you've done your worst fear and people have probably judged you, but you survived. You know, you didn't get fired, your partner didn't leave you, no one arrested you. And it's this idea to sort of build up your confidence so that you know that you can live through these super embarrassing things. So what was the super embarrassing thing you went off and did in public? So he decided that I since I hate talking to strangers, it's one of my biggest fears, that I should humiliate myself in front of strangers on purpose at the most embarrassing place, which we deemed would be the London Underground. And so he said, 'Why don't you ask people the question That's really embarrassing to have to ask. Yeah, I feel like even a normal…not like I'm abnormal, but even like a not shy person would balk at that. And I didn't want to do it, but then I just thought, why not? Like, I wanted to do everything. And so, yeah, I hailed down, like, a person in the Tube, and I said, 'Excuse me, I forgot, is there a Queen of England. And if so, what's her name?' And this man told me that her name was Victoria. And I remember my friend saying, no matter what you do in this situation, before you ask the question, you can't predict what's going to happen, and that was so right, because I never thought that would happen. I thought someone would laugh at me or yell at me or something, I never thought that they would say it was Victoria. So that was the experiment. I had to do that to 15 people. It was very nerve wracking. I'm actually starting to sweat thinking about it again. Did you have any positive encounters with that? I mean, yeah, a lot of the people, nobody was mean to me. People sort of looked at you a bit strange. And some women were just like, 'It's Elizabeth,' and, you know, they were kind. I think that we overestimate how judgemental people will be and underestimate how kind people will be. So step one was a success; she'd made contact with strangers, even if it was under really weird circumstances. The next challenge was to actually connect with strangers. For this, she spoke to behavioural scientist Professor Nicholas Epley from the Chicago Booth School of Business. Well, he told me about this concept called deep talk versus surface talk. And so, you know, surface talk is like what you had for dinner and the weather and how you get to work and all these really basic things, and how deep talk is more about your fears and your desires and your wishes, and how a lot of people can spend almost their entire life in surface talk and how that's just not meaningful and that's not how you make true connexions with people. And I'm sure we all have like moments like this or friends like this where you just sort of get stuck talking about the most boring things. And he said that if you want to go into deep talk and you don't know how, you have to be the person to make the first move. And so he said this motto, which I absolutely loved, which is 'nobody waves, but everybody waves back' and how you have to make the first move. And it just totally works. Like, if you if you do wave to someone, even if they think you're being very strange, they will wave back. If you say hi to someone, they'll say hi back. But there's this massive barrier between the first person to say that hello, to make that wave, that I found so hard to cross. Professor Nicholas Epley's research has looked extensively into the expectations and assumptions we all make about what other people are thinking about us. In a recent series of experiments published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, he and his colleagues had hundreds of strangers engage in conversations, some deep, some shallow. In the deep conversations, people had to reveal intimate information about their thoughts, feelings or experiences. The researchers found people consistently overestimated how awkward the deep conversation would be, and they also assumed their conversation partner wouldn't really care about the intimate information they'd be revealing, given they were just a stranger. But in fact, participants reported feeling more connected to the people they had 'deep' conversations with than those they had 'shallow' conversations with. They also felt happier for having had those conversations. It's these kinds of misunderstandings about what will make for an awkward vs pleasant interaction that can keep us circling in shallow conversational waters. So what did you do? How did you go about trying to have deeper conversations with people? Well, I also took this class in London called How to be Sociable, which sort of talked about the same concepts. And throughout the class you're paired with a different stranger. And you don't know each other's names or anything about yourselves, but you have to play this thing called vulnerability tennis. And the whole concept is that one of you says something embarrassing about yourself or shares a vulnerability. And the other person doesn't respond to that, they share their own insecurity, and you sort of bat these insecurities back and forth. And it's to show that we actually have a lot in common, it's not so scary to share these things, you won't be so badly judged by them. And it's the most freeing thing to say these things to a total stranger. So I was paired with this man who, you know, he just seemed confident, he was in his late 20s, and I didn't even know why he was there, because he seemed like he would be sociable. But he wanted to make new friends and he didn't know how. He was insecure about how much money he made and that he made less than his wife. Like, we sort of shared these things that you would never admit to other people or even your friends or your family. And I felt like we left with this amazing connexion. But then again, because we had shared these things in this sacred space, we couldn't actually go on to be friends because it was just too weird. But I did from then on take that lesson with me in life to sort of…you know, when you're stuck in this wheel of just weather and what you're going to eat and what your recipe is for food, you can just finally be like, 'What did you feel about like when that thing happened to you?' Or like, 'Do you ever think this?' And I think people generally really appreciate being asked these questions and finally, you know, going deeper. Okay, nice. So, as part of your year of being extroverted, you then started to try to make new friends as opposed to just making contact with strangers and never seeing them again. And trying to make friends as you get older gets harder, doesn't it? It's just not as easy in your 30s as it is in your early 20s. Right, exactly. I mean, I think the studies say that we have the most friends we'll ever have at 29 and then it sort of drops off a cliff, and other studies say it happens at 25. I think it's because we're not at university anymore usually, we're not at these new jobs where we're all starting new. Yeah, it definitely is hard. And I think people also really struggle with the idea of trying to specifically go out and seek new friendships. You know, it makes people feel maybe a bit icky or loser-ish or something like that. Did you struggle with that at all, trying to make a really concerted effort to make new friends? I do find that people find the concept of saying out loud 'I want new friends' really embarrassing, because when they you say that people hear 'I have no friends' and that's not true, I have lots of friends, they live all over the world. You know, I lived in Beijing, I lived in Australia, I'm from the States, I live in London now. So a lot of my best friends are totally very far away. But you obviously want to make friends in your city, people you can grab coffee with and get to know. And I think that it is hard to convince people about this, but I also think that most people are very open to making a new friend if that's presented to them. And one of things I learned about this is if you…I don't know, if there's a new person at work or someone you see around or if you're like a mum at the school gates and there's like another mum there that you like, why don't you just make the first move? I think that's the biggest thing, is sort of that 'nobody waves, everybody waves back' concept back again. And so throughout the book, I interview these mentors, I interviewed this friendship mentor, and she said her biggest advice was make the first move and make the second move. People are busy, people are hesitant, not everybody's done all this research that I've done and think about these things and, you know, really put yourself out there. And I think that the worst thing that happens is they say no or they don't want to, and then that's fine. And you can go on knowing that and you can move on to like a different friend who you'll like more who will like you back. That's interesting, I've never heard that before. You know, I've gotten the sense that make the first move is what you've got to do, but the second move, that's so important because that's really where it can go either direction, right? And it takes so much guts to actually do that, a lot of bravery. I mean, it's what I struggle with when it comes to making friends. I'm terrified of making the first move or the second move, but if someone does it with me, I'm like, yeah, I'm here for it, it's great. Being such a shy introvert, how did you psych yourself up and get brave to be able to do this? That's a really good question. It was really, really hard. But I think because I'd interviewed so many people and I'd done the research, I know it works. I know that if you talk to a stranger, it's usually actually something that gives you a dopamine hit, it makes you happy. If you reach out to people, you make new friends, that obviously contributes to our happiness. And I just thought, I don't really have anything to lose, because I'd also humiliated myself through Stefan Hofmann's experiment. And so I knew that after doing that, after asking people in London who the Queen was, I knew that there was nothing that would ever be as embarrassing as that. And that actually helped me ask someone I kind of knew if they wanted to grab a coffee, because normally…typically they're actually really happy you asked and really relieved you asked because I feel like…I don't know what it's like in Australia, but I feel like here in England people are a bit closed off, they don't want to make that move compared to, say, maybe like the States or something. In Australia it can be…I found it difficult for a long time to make friends here. I've been here a while now, so it's been okay. But I recently had someone who made that first move to initiate, you know, like a 'girl date', and I was very appreciative, it was great. I was like, 'Thank you for having the guts that I didn't.' But anyway, getting back to your story, so in an effort to start making friends, you downloaded a friend dating app, which I didn't even know existed, like a Tinder-like thing for friends. What was that like? How did that go? So I'm married, so I've never done the dating app thing, but basically Bumble has a feature for friends called Bumble BFF, and it's basically the same sort of concept, you swipe through, you see photos of people, you can see their hobbies, and yeah, you just sort of match with them and then you start chatting. And I met like tonnes of different women for comedy shows or a drink or coffee or a pub quiz. And I think, just like with online dating, it's a little bit awkward sometimes. Sometimes you don't have the spark, but also sometimes it's fine and you make a friend. And I feel like it was just a great experiment actually, to see what different kinds of people were out there. And yeah, I actually really loved it and totally recommend doing it. Tell me about the awkward parts though. Like, did you have many dates that were duds? Were there girl dates that were duds? Yeah, I think there were a few of those where maybe the person I'd matched with was really stuck in surface talk for ages. But if you don't even know a person, then surface talk is ten times as boring if you don't even know them, and that that was quite hard. It should be said that with friendship, you also need a spark, it's not just in romantic relationships, you also need to have some sort of thing in common or you need to enjoy each other's company. And I think that that can be a little bit tricky to find, but I think much easier than with romantic relationships. For all her app-based efforts, the closest friend Jessica actually made during this time was someone in her own building. But going on the dates and doing the communication tasks all gave her the confidence to broach that conversation IRL, in real life. So in the building I live in London, there's several flats in it and nobody ever talks to each other… Surprise, surprise. People totally avoid each other, hardly even say hi if you see each other in the hallway, and I'd come back from a run and was standing in front of the building and this woman popped out to take her trash out and I was like, 'Oh, I'm not here loitering, I live here.' And she was like, 'Oh, I know you live here, I've seen you around.' And then she was about to go back into her life. And I was just like, 'Hey, should we exchange numbers in case there's an emergency or there's a fire or something,' which I feel like it's not the coolest thing to say, but also very useful in case there is an emergency and, and she was like, 'Yeah, let's do that.' That small effort led to some texts, which led to a dinner, which led to a full-on friendship. To think, just a year earlier, this would have never happened. I would have just walked away and pretended like I didn't even see her, I would have crossed the street as soon as I saw the door open, definitely. And I think that's been the biggest takeaway from this whole year, is finally putting myself out there, actually making a close friend. And it's been really great actually, I think she's one of my best friends. You're listening to All in the Mind, I'm Sana Qadar. Today, an introvert's quest to become more extroverted. But let's zoom out of Jessica's story for just a moment and find out how many introverts vs extroverts are there? Is one of these traits more common than the other? So basically when we're looking at measuring human personality, the dominant model is pretty much known as the big five or the five factor model. Dr Andrew Spark is a personality scientist at the Queensland University of Technology, and the big five he's talking about include traits like conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism. We all have some variation of these traits, we just differ in terms of which ones are stronger or weaker. And, generally speaking, they're pretty much normally distributed, which pretty much means that, you know, as far as extroversion is concerned, most people are somewhere in the middle and are probably better described actually as ambiverts. Sometimes I get people that really want to push me on an answer on this question, which is fair enough, and I would say, look, we would probably find that around, say, 15% of the population, 15% to 20% of the population probably really stand out as being truly extroverted. And these people are really talkative, they're energetic, they're assertive, they love social interaction. And then equally down the other end of the of the continuum, you've probably got roughly an equal number of introverts who are very clearly, you know, they're much more shy, they're reserved and that sort of thing, and they tend to blend more into the background by choice. We're going to hear a lot more from Dr Andrew Spark next week when we dive into the neuroscience and psychology of introversion vs extraversion. We'll also talk about whether there's any gender differences in these traits. In her own attempts to connect with more people, journalist and self-described shy introvert Jessica Pan observed a big difference between how men do it vs women. Okay, so you've talked about putting yourself out there and making friends and if you just do that you can make some really wonderful relationships. But you have a really interesting chapter in the book where you discuss both loneliness and conversations with men in quite a lot of depth. And just sort of anecdotally or in my own experiences, I get the sense that men have a harder time connecting like this, and I think you observed that as well. What did you discover when you tried to have deeper conversations with men? I think you're right. So, studies say that women are just naturally much, much better at this, at emotionally connecting over things. And I don't know why, because I'm not myself a psychologist. I assume it's something to do with masculinity and not wanting to be seen a certain way. And also men…I don't want to stereotype, but a lot of men…so basically I live in England, the Premier League is a massive thing, and so many men are football fans compared to women. And I feel like when I would go out with my husband and his friends, they would just spend an hour talking about football, or he'd go out with his friends, his best friends, spend two or three hours out, he'd come back and I'd be like, 'Oh, is so-and-so…is he getting married soon? Or like, are they are they trying for kids? Or like, didn't he start a new job? Like, are they moving? Like, isn't his dad sick or something?' And he was like, 'I have no idea.' My husband was like, 'I don't know, we didn't talk about any of that stuff, we literally only talked about football.' And I was just like, oh my God. And I think that does serve its purpose where it allows men to go out and socialise without feeling this pressure of being examined. But I also think there are huge limitations to that where they don't feel close, they don't have anyone to vent to except for their partners really. And I think it's just so much more useful to vent to someone who would really understand your perspective. And so when you did try to have deeper conversations with men, how did that go? I mean, I think with everything I did in this book, it's important to say that I didn't talk to strangers who were scary or I didn't talk to anyone in, like, a dark alley at night. I picked the right people. You want to feel comfortable and I don't want them to feel uncomfortable. So I picked friends, people I kind of knew well to try to ask more about their life instead of football. And I feel like it went pretty well, they opened up because they were sort of pleasantly surprised. I asked one of my friends, he'd sort of travelled by himself for a year and I was like, if I travelled by myself for a year, I would have been really lonely. And he was like, 'I was really lonely.' He admitted that, you know, where normally you hear about the amazing things someone did, but you don't ever hear about something like that. By the end of her year-long journey into extroversion, Jessica had learned to talk to strangers, learned to connect more deeply with others, and made a close friend. She'd also tried her hand at improv and stand-up comedy. But the culmination of her efforts was to host a dinner party, something that had long been at the top of her list of nightmare activities. To me, a dinner party is the epitome of so many fears. It's like, okay, so you're hosting, you're bringing together different people and you're responsible for the fun they're having, and you also have to cook for them and you have to feed them. And if it's a bad party, it's your fault. And also, you can be judged by your home, your hosting skills, and you don't have an exit strategy. You know, normally if you're psyching yourself up to go to a networking event or a party, you're like, okay, but after I talk to two people, I can leave. You're in your own home. You cannot leave. Or it's very frowned upon to leave. Definitely. But I also thought I wanted to be the kind of person who could put on a spread and have different people from different parts of my life come over. I invited people from my comedy class and people from the friend dating app and people from improv, people I had met along the whole year to come to my house. Yeah. I mean, there was a bit of awkwardness but it sounds like it mostly went well. Can you sort of describe how it went? I feel like you do feel a responsibility as a host to paper over awkward silences because you know everything about everyone, and so if one of your friends says something to another friend and you know that friend feels very strongly about this issue or has experience with it, you want to jump in and be like, 'Oh, well David actually worked there for 20 years.'. And so I felt like I awkwardly was doing that. And also I'm not a great chef, the food was pretty average, I would say. But yeah, I think that it was it's great to just sort of see everyone else's conversations take off and people then take control it's great to see them making their own connexions in your home. Yeah, how did it feel to pull that off at the end, you know, one of your big nightmares, and have it go mostly well? Well, I do want to stress that because I'm still an introvert, I was absolutely wrecked afterwards, I was so exhausted because you have to be fully on. But it actually felt really satisfying. Okay. After this year of living like an extrovert, that's sort of wrapped up now, what have you taken from that experience, what skills, and how have you changed since trying all of this. Well, I feel like if I started the year as a shy introvert, a shintrovert, I've gotten over my fear of talking to strangers completely. And I would say I'm more of a gregarious introvert, which is like grintrovert. So during lockdown in London, our local cafe is the only place near us that stayed open, and I'd go in there every day with a mask on, and it was my only human interaction. But I would have the most amazing banter with these baristas, and it was the best feeling. And previously I would never talk to the baristas, I'd always feel way too shy to do that. So I feel like that's completely changed. I don't feel scared to talk to strangers now, and I actually can't believe I'm saying that. And are you happier now that you've made this change? How do you feel about your life now as a grintrovert rather than a shintrovert? I feel like…I think there's research that says that, you know, by the time we're 30 our personalities are pretty fully formed, but then there's other research that says it's not just nature and nurture, you can also change by what you do. So your personality can change as a result of action. So if you think about it, if you went and trained and climbed Mount Everest, you would be completely changed by that experience. If you did a year like my year, you'd also be changed. And so I find that really freeing and comforting, knowing that you don't always have to be bound to the person you've been your entire life. That's Jessica Pan, journalist, grintrovert, and author of Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come. Next week we're going to get in the science of personality, whether the brains of introverts and extroverts are different and how we develop these traits. That's in part two of our two-parter on introversion vs extroversion. This episode was produced by James Bullen, our sound engineer was Isabella Tropiano.

"And so to a new book called Tunnels in Time , a bit like that midden, except these are through caves and rocks, telling the story of our marsupials. It's written by Lyndall Dawson who now lives on the south coast of New South Wales. Tell me about the Wellington Caves, where are they and why do you think they are important? Wellington Caves are in western New South Wales, they have some tourist caves, nice, interesting tourist caves but they are not Jenolan, they're not anything pretty. They are interesting from a historical point of view, but most importantly they are interesting because they were the first place in Australia that our extinct marsupial species were discovered way back in 1830. Way back in 1830. Was someone looking for them or did they happen to be digging for something else? Actually in a way they were looking for them. At this stage in England the subject of extinct animals was alive and well because the Enlightenment had brought out the fact that maybe everything wasn't biblical, but fossils in England were being discovered and being ascribed to the biblical flood that had wiped them out. And so Australia, even in those days, because it had been settled 50 years before that, was a test case. We knew the fauna was really different here, and if Noah's flood had wiped out the lions and elephants and things that should have lived in Australia, that would prove the point. So people already were interested enough in Australian fauna to be testing that idea. And a chap who evidently was called a gentleman from Bathurst, Rankin, did some exploring around the Wellington area, west of Bathurst and…well, he was climbing into a hole in the ground in the limestone hill and he fell and grabbed a branch or a root or something that snapped off and it turned out to be a giant bone. And he was astute enough to contact the surveyor general, Sir Thomas Mitchell, tell him about it, who was astute enough and knowledgeable enough to know that this was a really important find. So that started it all. The Mitchell? The Mitchell, the Thomas Mitchell, yes. And what did the bone turn out to be? Well, it turned out to be very controversial, it was just a limb bone, but immediately Thomas Mitchell rode across the mountains on his horse to Wellington, that's how important they thought it was, and sampled bones out of that cave, sent them back to England where one of the bones was described by the most important anatomist at the time, Jameson I think, as the tusk of an elephant, which really fired up enthusiasm. I could imagine, it would prove the Bible was true. Exactly, that's right, but Thomas Mitchell himself was educated enough to be very sceptical about that elephant idea. And the other person who came into the story eventually was Sir Richard Owen who… That man. That man, and that man was I think probably one of the greatest geniuses on the planet because he could put these tiny little fragments of bits and pieces of broken bone together and turn them into animals and identify them, and he was always right. And sitting in the main hall of the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, but he wasn't right about evolution because he didn't actually like Darwin's ideas, did he. No, that's right. But he also named dinosaurs. However, that's Richard Owen. Meanwhile in Wellington of course, in the area and other parts of Australia, as you put in your book, the most amazing amount of digging and clearing of ground was going on. Did they actually take care to see whether there were any more bones, or was it just holocaust? Some people were actively looking for bones in those days, particularly up on the Darling Downs had just been settled and people who had just taken up pieces of land there would find big bones sticking out of the creek beds, and so they were interested enough to send them back to the museum and they sent them over to England in vast quantities from Victoria, from Queensland, many, many more from Wellington Caves, and it became a really important subject. It's interesting, isn't it, because your book is in three parts, and what we are talking about is the first part obviously which is the way in which the first explorations were being made just over 150 years ago, and painting a picture of what was a clearly different landscape with different fauna. And did it sink in fairly quickly, that Australia is completely different? Yes, actually, I think under Richard Owen who really took this subject under his wing and got…the Australian Museum opened up a few years after that, about 20 years later, you know… 1827. Richard Owen promoted exploration, found money for it. He by then was quite convinced that these were all marsupials, they were all related to the living fauna and that Australia was unique and different. And they were finding the most extraordinary animals. Diprotodon we know about, which is a hippo-sized wombat, if you like, but what about Thylacoleo? And this is a marsupial lion. What did it look like? It probably looked somewhat lion-like, yes, he had a nice round head with lots of muscles and things and a big jaw, about the same size as a female lion. It certainly was a very interesting controversial journey because, once again, Richard Owen twigged fairly quickly that this was a carnivore, although it had the most unusual dentition, different teeth from anything else and any other carnivore. It wasn't a little bit like Tasmanian Tigers, it had very unique teeth. And that sparked a huge controversy in England because the other anatomists said no, things with teeth like that have to be vegetarian because they have the same sort of teeth as the other…we called them diprotodons, the ones with two bottom teeth and two upper teeth that nibble grass and ate fruit and things like that. Thylacoleo had those sort of incisor teeth, nothing like a carnivore. But Owen stuck to his guns, Owen said it was a carnivore. But even in the 1920s, people were still arguing with that idea and saying it couldn't have been a carnivore. But studies have been done that have absolutely nailed it. And that's nearly 200 years later, it was still controversial. Quite interesting that in a cave in the Nullarbor, John Long and friends found Thylacoleo down in another huge cave, and I think it was several of them but this really was a terribly exciting find. Nullarbor Caves have just been the most exciting new find in the last 20 or 30 years in Australia, instead of all these fragmentary bits of bones that have been broken up, and they found whole skeletons and that's where…they've been putting this jigsaw of Thylacoleo together for 150 years but it didn't ever have a tail, they hadn't found its tail, and sure as eggs, yes, in the Nullarbor Cave they found Thylacoleo's tail, whacko, so they could put the whole animal together. Lyndall, what's your interest in this? Are you an archaeologist, are you a mammalogist or what? I was trained as a zoologist. I was lucky enough to meet up with people like Mike Archer when I was looking for a postgraduate topic, and there was a whole collection of stuff in the Australian Museum that hadn't been touched for 150 years that needed to be looked at, so that became the subject of my PhD. Once again, completely self-taught. And you're quite interested in, of course, the ever-controversial question about how some of these big animals…because you mentioned the Australian Museum, of course they had and still have in exhibition mode a few of these giant animals, huge kangaroo or one of the species of kangaroo you point out because there are many, many different species of kangaroo, and the big animals, the megafauna diminished in number. And in your book you review what might be one of the causes. How do you come up with a conclusion so far? Well, I'm trying carefully to step between the various parties that are interested in this subject, and this is where I first got most interested while I was doing this work at the museum. It became clear to me that people were completely divided in theories about how these things became extinct. One camp was saying that when humans first arrived in Australia, suddenly the megafauna just couldn't cope and were all hunted to extinction. Another camp in those days said that no, it went more along the lines that it did in North America where the ice age was approaching and the climate was changing, so that became extinct. Well, I knew neither of those tales really rang true, there must be something in between. And it's taken 40 years of work, and it's only in the last 20 years that…not my work but enough other work has been done because of improved technology in order to actually bring enough data to sort this controversy out. It's been a very active debate for a long time. A combination of the two; climate and people? Well, that's my theory, yes, because now that we have very good data on about 300,000 years of climate, leading up to a series of ice ages, I call it the rollercoaster of climate, we call it a glacial maximum not an ice age because in Australia it wasn't like Europe or North America where we had ice covering the land, but we did have extremely harsh, dry, cold periods. And the biggest of the megafauna survived up to about 300,000 years ago, this evidence comes from Nullarbor and Naracoorte Caves, that they were all doing very well, but the last two major ice ages after that started to have an impact on the fauna I think, and the evidence is everything was changing in Australia. We were heading into what we are now, an arid country. But one of the things that is pointed out to some extent by you and to some extent by other experts, when you're looking at the fossils of megafauna that have been killed, either by the weather or by people, what you might look for are any kind of cut marks as if they have been hit by clubs or I don't know what, that indicate that there had been violence in the killing rather than just slow demise. There was a story that was very popular in North America way back in the 1960s and 1970s. What I've decided is that Australia and North America had very similar problems with very, very different outcomes for the fauna, but in North America, particularly in Arizona and places like that, they did find deposits of extinct giant sloths and bears with tooth marks and spear points and things like that in them. But it transpires that most of the North American megafauna survived perhaps 30,000 years longer than the Australian megafauna. So the Australian megafauna disappeared perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, and there is no evidence of direct arrowheads or spear points or those sort of things in any of the fossils, except at Cuddie Springs in northern New South Wales there seems to be evidence of dried blood on stone implements, which is surprising after all that time. It could have been possums. It could have been possums, yes. But it doesn't necessarily take a spear to turn something extinct. Look at our koalas and things these days that we are worrying about extinction, but nobody is killing them off, they are just suffering from habitat destruction. So, similar things might have been happening then. It's a lovely book, congratulations. Thank you very much.

"Which diet is best at preventing cancer? And, if you've been diagnosed with cancer, which is more likely to improve your outcome? A wholefood, plant-based diet, or a low-carb ketogenic diet? Dr Neil Iyengar of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York has recently published an extensive review of the evidence. Thank you for having me. I mean, this diet debate goes back ages. I can remember a time when extremely low-fat diets were tested in cancer prevention and indeed improved cancer outcomes. You've focused in this study on a wholefood, plant-based diet and a ketogenic diet. Let's just get the definitions right. What are we talking about in terms of these diets? That is a great question because particularly with the plant-based diets and even the ketogenic diet there's a lot of variation. If we start with the plant-based diet, I generally consider a plant-based diet to be one in which 80% to 90% of the nutritional intake essentially comes from plant sources. And to go one step further, we were particularly interested in wholefood plant-based diets, and this is essentially where we would further define that 80% to 90% as minimally processed or minimally altered plant-based products as the major component of the diet, leaving a little bit of wiggle room for non-plant-based products and that's where we differentiate a plant-based diet from, say, a full-on vegetarian diet or a full-on vegan diet. And when you say on manipulated, you're talking about…it's not a protein ball, it's what Michael Pollan the food writer would say is food that your grandmother would recognise as food. Yes, exactly, this is foods from the garden, if you will, that are minimally altered, cooked in your kitchen, and put on your plate. Okay, let's go to the keto diet because, again, there's lots of confusion here because people are on low carbs, they are on 5:2 diets, they're on time restricted diets. Right, and so when we are talking about a ketogenic diet, at least in the context of this research, we are essentially talking about diets whereby the body is forced to use a different type of fuel, ketone bodies, hence the name of the diet. The way in which a person achieves ketosis is important but may be more variable based on the individual. The more common way to define a ketogenic diet is actually the macronutrient ratio, so the ratios of carbohydrates to proteins to fat. And the majority of ketogenic diets are essentially high in protein and low in carbohydrate, and that's because we are replacing the carbohydrate with protein. When we say low in carbohydrate, we mean very low, generally less than 30 to 40 grams of carbohydrates a day. Let's start with the epidemiological evidence, looking at what trials have been done and also the broad patterns in the population. What do we know about these two diets on a broad front when you look at the population evidence, before we get to the biochemistry and what they do to your body. The vast majority of population or observational evidence is actually regarding plant-based diets. We have several large cohort studies which have looked at the relationship between consumption of mostly plant-based foods and the incidence or the occurrence of various cancers, and what we see there are strong associations that have been found repeatedly across many different studies, many different populations in many different geographic regions, a strong association between higher consumption of plant-based products and lower incidence of several different cancers, predominantly cancers that are related to metabolism, like insulin levels, inflammation, and so these tend to be breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and so forth. At least 13 different cancers are metabolically mediated and have a lower incidence in populations that report higher intake of plant-based foods. And the ketogenic diet? So the ketogenic diet in terms of the observational data is less robust, and this is where we get into difficulties with regard to definitions of the ketogenic diet. Generally speaking we see studies that have categorised diets as low carbohydrate diets. Low carbohydrate diets have been associated with a lowering of risk of some cancers, although the associations are not as strong as what we see in the plant-based diets. But when we really dive down to ketogenic diets, there are very few studies that cleanly look at the relationship in large populations between those who consume ketogenic diet and the incidence of cancer, and the results of those studies are mixed. Some studies have found a protective effect or a protective association I should say, with the ketogenic diet and a few cancers. Now, those studies are a bit problematic because it is difficult to tease out whether it truly was the ketosis or whether or not it was weight loss or other factors that that are achieved with a ketogenic diet that may also be achieved with a plant-based diet. So let's dig down and compare, if you like, the biochemistry, what these diets do in your body, and of course the word on everybody's lips or tongue I should say is microbiome. When you put these side-by-side in terms of a wholefood, plant-based diet and ketogenic diet, what did you find? Well, there's far more data with plant-based diets than there are with ketogenic diets. What we did find was that individuals or populations that consume plant-based diets seem to have far more favourable changes in their gut microbiome than those who consumed ketogenic diets. There are some studies that suggest that the diversity of the gut microbiome may actually decrease with ketogenic diets, and that's likely related to more singular sources of protein, namely animal. You also looked at where you lose your weight from when you are on these two diets, and your suggestion is that on the ketogenic diet you lose more muscle. Yes, one of the things that we are very concerned about is body composition. Individuals with advanced cancer can have wasting syndromes or cachexia where they have a very low volume of muscle. And we also know that muscle can be protective against the development of cancer. One of the things we were interested in in our review of the available data was whether or not these diets differentially impacted body composition. And we did generally see for those who were using either diet, the plant-based diet or the ketogenic diet, for weight loss purposes, we did see that those who consumed plant-based diets were more likely to lose higher amounts of fat compared to muscle, whereas individuals consuming a ketogenic diet with the goal of weight loss had either an equal loss of fat and muscle or sometimes a greater loss of muscle than fact, which was particularly concerning as we know that muscle is protective against the development of cancer. Half the world seems to be on either a 5:2 diet, in other words five days of fairly free eating, two days maybe on 500 calories each which are ketogenic days, or time restricted eating where you don't eat anything from maybe 8 o'clock in the evening until about 1- or 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Have any of those being tested in terms of cancer prevention or the effects on the body that might lead to cancer prevention? There is great interest in time mediated feeding and fasting. It turns out that fasting has positive impacts on insulin levels which of course is a protective effect against cancer. However, individuals who follow an intermittent fasting type diet after achieving a healthy body weight, for example, may actually be exposing themselves to a higher risk of losing muscle mass, and from a cancer perspective, again, that is very concerning. One of the first questions that any cancer specialist gets from someone with cancer after they've got over the shock of the diagnosis is, 'How should I change my diet, Doctor, to benefit myself?' Did you come to any sort of answer there? Because clearly if diets change your metabolism, diets can affect how your cancer progresses and it might even interfere or enhance the drugs you are giving. What did you discover about that? This is such an important question and I think that historically we as oncologists have really not paid enough attention to this question, even though patients are asking us this question, as you pointed out. My strong recommendation is to follow a plant-based diet. But I will make one major caveat to that and that is that there are certainly very specific types of cancer where the ketogenic diet may actually be beneficial, and we are studying about in randomised controlled trials. But by far for most cancers the plant-based diet carries the most cancer protective effects. And which cancers are they that may have a ketogenic benefit? Well, there are certain tumours that are highly dependent on insulin or that are treated with medications that drive up insulin levels. And while a plant-based diet can be very successful at lowering those insulin levels, there are actually studies in mice which suggests that for tumours which have a specific type of genetic mutation called a PI3-kinase mutation, specifically breast tumours with PI3-kinase mutations that are treated with PI3-kinase inhibitors, the ketogenic diet may be beneficial for improving the efficacy of that cancer treatment. That needs to be proven in humans and we have an ongoing study that is testing that question. But there are other PI3-kinase mutated cancers, like certain blood cancers or leukaemias, where the ketogenic diet may actually have the opposite effect and be harmful. So before we go recommending the ketogenic diet for every person with that kind of cancer, a PI3-kinase mutated cancer, we really need to wait for the human diet, and in the meantime the plant-based diet still appears to be protective for those types of cancers. So, the bottom line, Neil, is whether you've got cancer or you are trying to prevent it, bias yourself towards a wholefood, plant-based diet, watch how you lose your weight so that you maintain muscle mass, and retain ketogenic diets, at least at the moment, for highly specific situations. That is exactly what I would conclude from our current state of the evidence. Thank you very much for joining us on the Health Report. My pleasure, thank you for having me.

"G'day, Dr Karl here. Have you ever geared up for the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb? You have to take everything out of your pockets, especially metal coins. How come? Could you really kill somebody by dropping a coin from a great height? As it turns out, people around the world have done different versions of this experiment and the answer is almost certainly a resounding ""no"" – at least with regular coins. In the early 2000s, the physicist Lou Bloomfield from the University of Virginia tried to mimic the dropping of a coin from a tall building. He cleverly combined helium balloons with a radio-controlled mechanism to release the coin once the balloon got high enough. He then tried to catch the falling coins. He caught, and even got hit, by a few of the falling coins. He said that it was not painful, and that it felt like being flicked by a finger on the forehead – ""… but not even very hard"". According to the popular science journal, the Scientific American, he said, ""The pennies didn't hurt. They bounced off me and it felt like getting hit by bugs, big raindrops, or little hail pellets. No bruises, no injuries. I was laughing the whole time."" Now, given that a coin is made from dense metal, how come the falling coins didn't even hurt him? The short answer is that they were not falling fast enough. On one hand you do have the ever powerful suck of gravity pulling the coin towards the ground ever faster with each passing second – but to get this continual acceleration, the coin has to fall in a vacuum. Our regular coin is falling down, however, in our atmosphere. So gravity gets opposed by the atmosphere. Furthermore, our coin doesn't fall vertically straight down, but flutters to the ground like a leaf – sliding left and then right while being roughly horizontally aligned. Now I'm talking about your average coin, weighing a gram or two, and about a centimetre or two across. I'm definitely not talking about the South African gold coin called the Krugerrand, which weighs about 33 grams and is about 33 millimetres across. If one of those were to fall edge first, it could build up some considerable speed and cause some damage – thanks to its weight and vertical alignment. But with your average falling coin, after about 15 metres of falling, the suck of gravity is balanced by the resistance of the wind – and the coin reaches the speed chillingly known as its Terminal Velocity. However, in our atmosphere, this speed is relatively low – around 45-50 km/h. If there was no atmosphere, a coin could accelerate to around 335 km/h which is fast enough to cause some damage if it hits somebody. According to studies from the American National Rifle Association, 110 km/h is enough to penetrate the skin, while 220 km/h will shatter bone. Atmosphere is one thing, but shape is another. For example, a falling heavy metal ballpoint pen could cause huge damage if it fell from a great height. If it were to drop vertically like an arrow, the combination of its terminal velocity of around 300 km/h, combined with its small hard-pointed end, could penetrate a human skull. Certainly, bullets fired vertically, definitely cause damage on the return leg to Earth. Depending on the weight and shape of the falling bullet they can reach speeds between 330 and 770 km/h on the way down. In Kuwait after the end of the Gulf War, the Kuwaitis celebrated by firing weapons into the air – and 22 people died from falling bullets. In Los Angeles, between the years 1985 and 1992, the King-Drew Medical Centre treated 118 people for Random falling-bullet injuries. 38 of them died, while most of the survivors were left with severe long-term disabilities, such as chronic pain, seizures, paraplegia and quadriplegia. In Sydney, a nine-year-old Sydney girl was watching fireworks with her parents from their driveway to celebrate the incoming New Year of 2002. At five minutes after midnight, a bullet fell out of the sky and lodged in her upper arm. A few centimetres closer to her centreline, and she could've been killed. The Mythbusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, tried a variation of this experiment. They made a mini cannon that could fire a small coin at around 100 km/h – about twice the speed of a falling coin. They aimed it into one of their favourite props, a ballistics dummy, which ended up with only minor damage. Then, made courageous by this knowledge, they fired coins at each other. Yes, they did sting, but no, they did not cause any damage. When a coin landed on Adam's hand, he said it hardly hurt. And that coin was moving faster than a coin dropped from the Empire State building, or the Sydney Harbour Bridge. But if it were raining cats and dogs, well, that would be a whole different box of frogs.",422.424,7.0404,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/deadly-falling-coins.mp3,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/deadly-falling-coins.txt,deadly-falling-coins,834,118.45917845576956
"G’day, Dr Karl here. Today, I’m following on with the story that over the last two years, the days have been getting shorter. Yes, it is only a few thousandths of a second less, but it’s real. The days are in fact getting shorter and the Earth is truly spinning faster - and this is totally against the long-term trend of the last several billion years. Time used to be measured by the movement of the Sun. But we’ve moved on. Now, we have two major super-precise ways of measuring time – Atomic Time and Astronomical Time. Atomic Time totally ignores the Sun, and the spin of the Earth. It is based entirely on a world-wide network of some 400 calibrated atomic clocks. Atoms don’t change what they do with time, so atomic time is fixed. Astronomical Time is different. It uses atomic clocks, but to measure the spin of the Earth by looking at the very distant galaxies. We’ve been using this method with our radio telescopes since the 1970s. And thanks to these super-accurate clocks, we discovered that the Earth does not spin at a constant rate. And averaged out over the last century, the day has gotten longer by about three milliseconds – up until the last two years. A human is not going to notice three thousands of a second. But the international networks used by banks and computers do – because they run on very precise timing. Time did actually did begin with the Big Bang, but as far as computers are concerned, time began on January 1, 1970 which was zero hours, zero minutes and zero seconds UTC . So since we began using atomic time and astronomical time, we’ve had to introduce the leap second – which is an extra second in the year. The first one was added in 1972. The 27th was added in 2016. Computers need a single and accurate coordinated time. At the moment, all of our devices such as Smart Phones, tablets, computers and communication systems work only because they are absolutely synchronised through NTP . If they’re not synchronised, programs can crash, data can be corrupted, GPS will stop telling you where you are, and banks will stop giving you money. So how do you add a leap second? Normally, on the 31st of December, the clock would shift from 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds to zero hours, zero minutes and zero seconds. But, when we want to add in a leap second, we instead shift from 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds to 23 hours 59 minutes and 60 seconds – not 59 seconds, but 60 seconds. That’s where the extra second gets added in. Normally, the insertion of a leap second is announced some six months in advance. The overall goal is to keep the difference between “Atomic Time” and “Astronomical Time” to less than one second. Until now, it’s always been the addition of an extra second because the spin of the Earth has been slowing. The last two years are the first that we’ve ever seen the Earth spinning faster. Adding a leap second is something the IT Officers in every company in the world have to sort out. But sometimes the addition of a leap second goes bad, and so we’ve seen outages happening with the social media site Reddit back in 2012, and the web network company Cloudflare in 2017 – because the IT Officers managed it badly. Most organisations simply add that extra second at midnight. Some people are saying that instead of interfering with the Official Clock every few years , we should just left the difference between Atomic Time and Astronomical Time drift until it gets to about 10 seconds - and then do one big shift, only every few decades. How come, for the first time ever recorded in human history, the Earth is spinning faster? At this early stage, we don’t know. It could be the shifting of water due to Climate Change, or tectonic plate activity on the surface of the Earth, or changes deep underground in the mantle, or in the liquid ball of iron in the core, or even in the solid ball of iron in the innermost core. But as of mid-2022, we don’t know. But, given how important accurate clocks are for every aspect of our modern life, keeping everything in sync is an issue second to none.",422.17716666666666,7.036286111111111,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/earth-is-accelerating-pt3.mp3,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/earth-is-accelerating-pt3.txt,earth-is-accelerating-pt3,740,105.16911738871082
"Hello, I'm Robyn Williams, and we start this adventure in the Queensland Museum in Brisbane where Sophie Price is about to help open the Coral Connections exhibition. The question is, how did people first come here, apart from starting at the top end? And the answers come from some stunning new archaeology. My name is Sophie Price, I'm the Assistant Curator of Anthropology at Queensland Museum Network. But you're normally in Townsville, are you? I am, yes, so I work at the Museum of Tropical Queensland in Townsville but that's within the Queensland Museum Network, so we are spread across the four campuses across the state. And I imagine crossing the Coral Sea they would have come to the area which is now called Townsville rather more quickly than Brisbane. Absolutely, it was really important that we had this exhibition first up at the Museum of Tropical Queensland last year as the first instance of the exhibition, and then it has come down here to share the story with south-east Queensland. I must say that I've always thought of people first coming to Australia from the kind of Macassan region, Indonesian archipelago and so on from the straight north. But coming from the east, how long has that been well-known? Well, it's a really interesting story and I think we are only starting to really delve into the depth of that. So this exhibition that CABAH is doing and that the museum is assisting with in the exhibition, it's all based with the traditional owners on Jiigurru, on the Lizard Island and up in that Dingaal country, and it's telling a different sort of story, so instead of talking purely about human expansion, you know, straight to Australia, we are looking at human expansion down the coast of Queensland and how long ago that was happening and what was happening at the same time. But how long did it take? A long time, I think. You'll see in the exhibition there's some canoes and it would have taken a long time to traverse the sea. Let's go in. And I can see four canoes now. They're quite large actually. And before you had horses, of course water was the main real fast…that humans could travel and explore. Yes, absolutely, and it was really important for us to showcase the size and the extent of these canoes, of these seafaring vessels, so the first section of the exhibition you are really introduced to that concept of seafaring and how people moved and how they were transferring ideas and objects across the water. Some people suggested that not just the canoes but some of the sailing boats, and you've got one here in front of me, it looks very swish, one of the greatest inventions in human history. I would second that, absolutely. You look at the size of them and the significance of them and they are just amazing objects, so, definitely incredible. Okay, there's a long set of three canoes here. One of them is about four, five metres long. Yes, longer, it's almost up to six metres I believe. So we've got them stacked up on the wall and that's just showing the size of these ones, and then over the other side of the exhibition we actually have a fully formed outrigger canoe from Yarrabah, we call it bunul in the language from Yarrabah, and it is the only canoe that we have in the collection here that still has its outrigger attached, so it's really, really important. They look as if they are carved from one tree. They are, yes, and it's amazing when you think of the size of what the tree would have looked like and then transferring that into an object. So you've got to know what you want to achieve, it's a bit like making a statue with a lump of rock. Definitely, I would say it's even more crafty. Where do these three come from? These ones are actually drift canoes, so they would have come down from PNG and then they've washed up onto land up in the Cape region and then they've been collected. And they've been in a museum ever since? They have been, yes, so I think these ones were all early 1900s, one of them was collected around the 1930s, 1940s. Yes, very old. Does anyone know at this distance in time whether the explorers knew where they were going? That's an interesting question. Without the context of these particular objects, we can't be sure. With some of the other objects and obviously with oral histories from our traditional owners, they know where they were going and they know what their ancestors were doing. Some of the clues of course…we once did a Science Show series on the invention of navigation, but from the ark of course the whole point of sending up the dove, the dove would go into the sky and spot dry land and go off in that direction. So if you watched the animals, and indeed the coconuts floating, you could get clues. Yes, absolutely, and just on that point we do have…when you walk into the exhibition we've got this beautiful constellation that you walk underneath, and that's Tagai and that's a Torres Strait Islander constellation and it's one of the key ones that people were using up in the Straits to navigate across those waters, so it's very similar. Further around, before I talk to one of your colleagues, wonderful carving, it looks as if it has a great big rudder, it's very beautiful… Yes, we've got canoe prows and washboards, so these are, again, are telling that seafaring story and just showing intricacy of the detail as well of all of these crafts. And further along here, we talk about the generations who are involved, there's a wonderful picture of the sea people, mostly men. Did women travel much, do you know? As far as I know women didn't travel on these canoes, definitely not up in the Straits or Cape York that I'm aware of. However, that might be knowledge that's not shared with us in the museum, and yes, we will have to look into that further. Are you an anthropologist? Yes, so I work in anthropology, so particularly First Nations and social history. Before I let you go, just one quick glance over here, which looks like some of the material that came out of the boats, from beads, tools… Yes, all sorts of things, so this area of the exhibition is talking about that cultural exchange, so it's looking at in particular all of the items that were shared across the Coral Sea, so between the cultural groups of New Guinea, Torres Strait, and North Queensland, and it also goes into items that weren't shared, so it's looking at the agency and the decision-making of all these cultural groups, what they wanted to share and what they didn't. Thank you very much, very exciting. Thank you so much, I hope you enjoy. Sophie Price, and her message clearly is these connections were not a one-way passage, this was a lively to-ing and fro-ing like any sophisticated interaction between communities across the Coral Sea over 6,000 years ago. And so to the distinguished Professor of Indigenous Archaeology from Monash, down the hole, Ian McNiven. At the exhibition there's a wonderful sequence of you down the hole, which is a deep hole going down thousands of years, and it looks as if it's a wall until you look closer and you can see the stones and also thousands of large shells showing that's where people ate all those years ago. What were you measuring down that hole? History, in a word, but thousands of years of Aboriginal history, and that's why we do it and that's why we've spent a lot of time…I mean, I spent days down that hole, but it's because we know it's all going somewhere and it's this wonderful understanding that you have that Aboriginal people have been in places literally for thousands of years, and there it is right in front of your eyes, you're just seeing thousands of meals layered up in front of you. So it's a wonderful experience, it's a wonderful privilege to be able to do this sort of work and, boy, if I can get paid to stand in a hole for weeks… Making notes, yes, but the wonderful point that you make is that people might have said that's a midden, in other words that's a rubbish dump, it is not, it's systematic, and you've also got Lapita pottery. They didn't think that there was pottery around in that area, and what you describe of that sort of discovery was it's amazing stuff, it's really ground-breaking stuff, literally. Well, you never know what you're going to find when you do archaeology and that's why we do it because it's always full of surprises. And what I like about what we've done working on Lizard Island is that we knew there were lots of places there where Aboriginal people have been, it's their home. It might be a shell midden, and that's what archaeologists call it, but at the end of the day this is somebody's home and it's been home for hundreds of generations of people, so we always have that in mind. But yes, the pottery we've found…we're not too sure whether it actually is Lapita or might be just after Lapita. Either way, it's related somehow. That's a group of people, the Lapita people. Yes, the Lapita people who are the famous people who first went out into the Pacific to settle the remote Oceania. We only ever thought that they went out, basically headed east, but now we know that there was another arm of Lapita that came along the south coast of Papua New Guinea and possibly the last Lapita people or the next few generations then moved further west, came into Torres Strait, and those influences came down the Queensland coast with Aboriginal people. So there's something going on between 2,000 to 3,000 years ago where everybody is connected over thousands of kilometres on these what we call canoe highways where ideas and objects are being shared, and we've seen that right here in this exhibition. There are a couple of surprises about what you've done here, and one of them is we imagine of course human beings out of Africa, it's as if they knew where they were going over thousands of years, down to Australia, 65,000 years ago. But what you show with the excavations is that people were coming and going, they didn't just come down south, they went north as well. Well, I started going to Torres Strait 25 years ago but we had no idea that we were going to find pottery there as well, so that was all new because historically there is no pottery in Torres Strait, but there we found it, between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago. And of course, as most people know, Aboriginal people did not traditionally make pottery. So when we were doing the work on Lizard Island, we were shocked, literally shocked to find this pottery buried deeply in this shell midden. And it talks to the history of Aboriginal people that, as you say, it's not isolation. Aboriginal people have been interacting with people overseas, we know that with the Macassans over perhaps 1,000 years, we're not too sure, but also there's another connection that goes up through Torres Strait into Papua New Guinea. So Aboriginal people have had international relationships, trading relationships, social relationships, family relationships going back for thousands of years that extend beyond our shores, and I find that a fantastic story. How come you were working so far north when in fact you are based in Melbourne? It's cold. I'm originally from Queensland, I'm very committed to the history and the Indigenous history and cultures of Queensland, so I love working up here. And what would your message be to the public now that this exhibition is open, telling this amazing story, why should they come along to the Queensland Museum? Because it will change the way that you view the history of Queensland, it will change the way that you view the Indigenous people of Queensland. There are things here that you will see that we literally did not know existed up until a couple of years ago. So, if you want a new experience, a new understanding of the state that you live in, come along to this exhibition. Thanks Ian. Thank you, Robyn. Ian McNiven is Professor of Indigenous Archaeology at Monash. And a final word from Sean Ulm, deputy director of the Centre of Excellence of Biodiversity and Heritage. He's usually based in Cairns, northern Queensland. We are standing next to the representation of the hole in the ground where Ian was. What do you think of that? One of the best things you've done, you were saying? This excavation has been extraordinary on Jiigurru or the Lizard Island group, working in partnership with the traditional owners. There are very few middens anywhere in Australia, and particularly on the east coast of Australia, that are as deep as this one. So the lowest cultural material at this excavation was at nearly two metres, and those shells at two metres down were reef shells from the edge of the reef crest at the edge of the lagoon and they still had the colour on them, and they are radiocarbon dated at 6,500 years ago, and they were buried so rapidly that the sun didn't have time to bleach the colour of them. It's an incredibly rare thing in my career, working around the world on coastal sites, to see such extraordinary preservation. But the real humdinger of this was the pottery that we found. Between 60 and 80 centimetres below the surface we found dozens of sherds of pottery dating between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago which we believe to be the oldest pottery in Australia. Quite extraordinary, isn't it, and what I love about this exhibition, apart from the fact that we've got a simulacrum of being down the hole, being down the dig, is you've got a screen there where visitors can point to a sort of lump and it explains what it is and shows you the creature that might have been and how deep it is and how old it is. Well done. Absolutely. One of our real priorities here was to get this into the public realm. So, very few people have the opportunity to visit an archaeological site or a cultural place and participate in an archaeological excavation. So, right from the beginning of the project we were thinking of ways we could develop outreach products. So, a 3D, full-scale print of the pit, so that people could actually touch and feel and stand inside the pit was one part of it, but the interactive screen was really important, particularly for school outreach. And you might have noticed, Robyn, that we've got Indigenous language names in that interactive display and throughout the exhibition, which is really honouring that Indigenous centred approach to the entire partnership that gave rise to this project. Well Sean, you are about to open with the distinguished parties, including the director of the museum, so congratulations and thank you. Thanks again, Robyn. That was Distinguished Professor Sean Ulm, James Cook University, based in Cairns. He is also deputy director of the Centre of Excellence for Biodiversity and Heritage, which also mounted the exhibition that has just opened at the Queensland Museum in Brisbane.",829.88,13.831333333333333,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/exhibit-shows-voyages-of-ancient-cultures-around-the-coral-sea.mp3,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/exhibit-shows-voyages-of-ancient-cultures-around-the-coral-sea.txt,exhibit-shows-voyages-of-ancient-cultures-around-the-coral-sea,2621,189.49727671470575
"Hello, and welcome to this week's Health Report with me, Norman Swan. And me, Tegan Taylor. Today, GPs role in weight management. What if your doctor could prescribe you fresh produce for free? I'd never really thought about eating nuts previously but now I will have nuts instead of a bag of chips, you know, maybe an orange instead of glasses of orange juice. That's interesting prescribing, later on on the Health Report. And, time restricted eating, a form of intermittent fasting where you limit your eating to a few hours of the day and fast the rest of the time. Anecdotally, at least from the questions I get from you, there is huge interest in both the health and weight loss benefits, if any, of time restricted eating. Well, now there has been a randomised trial of weight loss in a group of obese people who are all on calorie restriction, but half had their calories in a narrow time window. One of the senior researchers was Dr Courtney Peterson who is Associate Professor of Nutrition Sciences at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and I spoke to her earlier. Thank you so much for having me. There is huge interest in time restricted eating, the 5:2 diet, et cetera, but what did we know particularly about time restricted eating before you did your randomised trial? Can you remember that long ago? Well, we've done a number of studies in my lab but when I first got started there were maybe only one or two studies out there, and one of them had actually tested what happens when you eat in about a four-hour period and fast for the rest of the day. So, time restricted eating, just for your audience, is any sort of intermittent fasting approach where you shorten your daily eating window, which you can do either by eating breakfast later in the day and/or dinner earlier in the day. So, for instance, a lot of people normally fast for about 12 hours a day, you might lengthen that to 16 or 18 hours a day. So, prior to our work there had been a little bit of research on time restricted eating, it really came to the forefront in 2012 with a really fascinating study showing that if rodents practiced time restricted eating, even if they eat the same amount of food, they actually gain less weight, they have better blood sugar control, lower cholesterol levels, lower levels of inflammation, and just across the board they are a lot healthier. But rats aren't humans. Correct, rats aren't humans. So back over a decade ago, my lab saw this research and thought this is fantastic, this is really interesting, what happens if we actually test this in humans, will we get the same impressive results? So my lab did a study where we took men with prediabetes and we had them try eating in a six-hour window and fasting 18 hours a day and also eating over about a 12-hour window and fasting 12 hours a day. In this particular study we made them eat the same amount of food on both schedules, so that way if there were any differences between schedules, it wasn't because one group was eating different food or more or less food. And what we found in that first study that we did is we found that the time restricted eating improved their blood sugar levels and their blood sugar control, it also lowered their blood pressure by about 10 to 11 points, which is pretty large, and we also found some improvement in what's called oxidative stress, so this is a form of molecular damage in the body. And we followed that up shortly afterwards trying to figure out, okay, so there is a bunch of research suggesting that intermittent fasting helps you lose weight. Why is that? Is it because it helps you magically burn more calories, or is it because it helps you eat less? Is it doing something to help suppress your appetite? And so we did a really cool study where we brought people who were overweight in to our research centre and we had them spend 24 hours in what's called a metabolic or respiratory chamber, so this is a really cool room that measures how many calories you burn and it does that by measuring how much oxygen you breathe in and how much carbon dioxide you breathe out. And what we found in the study is it doesn't look like time restricted eating helps you burn more calories, instead it looks like it actually suppresses your appetite. So we measured an appetite hormone called ghrelin and we actually found that the time restricted eating lowered levels of ghrelin, and our participants also said that it made their hunger levels more even-keeled throughout the day. So this new study is a randomised trial in people with obesity where everybody is on energy restriction but some are on time restricted eating. That's correct. Following our first two studies, we were really interested in the question; does time restricted eating help you lose weight when you're trying to lose weight? And in this particular study we were interested in trying a form of time restricted eating called early time restricted eating. So we did a study, we took adults who had obesity…our hospital has a weight loss program, it's what we call a medically supervised weight loss program, and we enrolled them in that program for 14 weeks. And participants were randomised to either a control group where they were instructed to eat over a 12-hour or longer period each day, or we had them eat over an eight-hour period and do 16 hours of daily fasting. So these are your 16:8 intermittent fasting approaches. And we had them do this eight hours of eating between 7am in the morning and 3pm in the afternoon, so a little bit more on the extreme side of things. And then we gave them all kinds of weight loss counselling and support. So we had a dietician meet with them once a month, every week they had group classes on exercise… They both had that? Yes, we provided those classes, and that was matched across groups, so both groups got the same weight loss treatment. And what we found at the end of the study is that the participants who were trying to lose weight and who did the early time restricted eating lost significantly more weight, and we were able to trace that back or back-calculate how many calories that was equivalent to cutting, and we found out it was equivalent to cutting an extra 200 calories a day. So we're finding the early time restricted eating gives you about a moderate boost in weight loss and helps you eat about 200 calories fewer per day. So they were actually eating less in the day, it wasn't the equivalent of 200 calories, they actually were eating 200 calories a day less. It was the equivalent of eating 200 calories per day. We don't know for certain whether they were eating less or being physically active. In our study we didn't find that they were reporting eating less, but most other studies have found that people do eat less. What could be going on here? First of all, if you fast for 12 hours or 18 hours, you're going to become a bit keto, it's going to be a bit ketogenic, and that could be causing the difference. Did you look at whether or not it was actually effectively a ketogenic diet? Yes, we've looked at that in another study in my lab and we actually find that ketone levels don't go very high with time restricted eating and that you need to be fasting for more like two days to really see a big increase in ketone levels. We do see a small increase but we don't think that's what's going on here. We have found in other studies that time restricted eating lowers that appetite hormone ghrelin. And there was another study that just came out this year that found that when you do time restricted eating you lose an extra about 50 calories per day in your urine and your stool, so there may be a combination of factors here that help people lose more weight. And the other issue is how much weight you're losing through fat loss versus muscle loss. You don't want to lose muscle, you want to lose fat. Correct. In our study we found the extra weight loss was entirely through fat loss, and we found they were able to retain their muscle mass, which was great. And diet quality? One of the issues with more extreme forms of dieting is that people tend to ignore their diet quality and think they can eat anything they like. Absolutely, and in our study we didn't find that the time restricted eating either helped people eat more healthily or made them eat worse, it was just about the same. We found that most people ended up practising time restricted eating by just eating the same foods as before and the same number of meals as before and just compressing that into a shorter time period. You've done a 14-week study, which is great, but people have got to do this presumably for life if you are obese, or certainly for an extended length of time, and the question is how sustainable it is, and one of the issues here is if you're not eating dinner, dinner is often when people socialise, so how sustainable is it? Yes. So, I don't think early time restricted eating is going to be for everyone. In our study we asked participants to follow it six out of seven days a week, and most of them were able to follow it, nearly everyone was able to follow it five out of seven days a week for those 14 weeks. What was quite interesting is that in the beginning of this study almost no one wanted to try early time restricted eating, but by the end of the 14 weeks about 40% of participants in the study wanted to continue with it. So we think there's something about the weight loss benefits or the mood benefits that a significant number of people are willing to try it. But the good news is the data suggests that even if you do time restricted eating by eating a little bit later in the day you still get some benefits. And then if intermittent fasting is just not for you, the data suggests that if you still try to eat more of your calories early in the day, such as have a big breakfast or lunch, that still helps improve your health. And the other issue with the more extreme forms of diet is that your body adjusts to the lower calorie intake and your resting metabolic rate goes down, and therefore the calorie gap reduces or you get reduced benefit as time goes on. Did you notice that in this study? We did not in this study, we didn't measure how many calories people burned, but we have another larger study where we are going to answer this exact question. Courtney, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. Dr Courtney Peterson is Associate Professor of Nutrition Sciences at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. So Tegan, are you going to just now give up on dinner? No man, no way. It sounds like it's good for the people in her study but I think perhaps our next story might shed a bit more light on diet quality. You're listening to the Health Report. Doctors are really good at prescribing medicine. You know, the thing you get after you are already sick. But our health system doesn't really support them to prescribe things that aren't medicine, that we know help prevent people from getting sick or sicker in the first place. But a recent study has tried to be a proof of concept on how that could look, prescribing free healthy food boxes to people with poorly managed diabetes who are living with food insecurity. One of the people who received the boxes was Emma who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around the start of the pandemic. I spoke with her earlier. I was going a very rough time with depression and at that time being newly diagnosed, it's extremely daunting. You know, I had to make choices and I probably didn't make the best choices. I'd be searching or eating food at 2 o'clock in the morning, something crazy like a bowl of pasta or sandwiches, and my portions were out of whack. It was an absolute joy to wake up in the morning and prepare a breakfast, you know, nuts, fruit, a piece of toast, coffee. It seemed to regulate my waking hours, my exercise, it lifted my daily energy levels, changed my shopping habits. I started to read the back of labels when I'd never really done that before. So this was a 12-week program and it's finished now. How are you going now you are sort of back on your own again? I think what is great about this study is it is fresh ingredients that you can now just go to the supermarket and implement those kind of dietary changes. I'd never really thought about eating nuts previously but now I will have nuts instead of a bag of chips, you know, maybe eat an orange instead of glasses of orange juice. As daunting as diabetes is, I feel like I'm managing the food part of things way more sensibly than before. That was Emma, a participant in a recent pilot study into prescribing healthy food to people with food insecurity. One of the brains behind the study itself was Professor Jason Wu from the George Institute for Global Health. Welcome Jason. Thanks for having me. So we heard Emma talking there about the healthy food boxes that were provided but that wasn't all that was involved in this pilot study, was it. That's right, so in addition to providing the healthy foods, which is really about improving people's access to some of the most important ingredients we know that are for our health, we also did provide dietary education as well, so we really want to acknowledge that people may have to…they need both, they need to have the knowledge about what they should be eating, how to cook it, how to store it, but also at the same time having access to these foods or it means that they can actually action on that knowledge and make it a reality. So people with food insecurity, that seems relatively self-explanatory, but there are lots of diseases that involve diet, or diet can help moderate. Why did you choose diabetes for this study? So, type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic conditions in Australia, and we know that diet without a doubt is one of the most important factors driving the increasing prevalence of diabetes in our society. So that's why we really wanted to look at…and also one other thing to quickly mention as well, people experiencing food insecurity and type 2 diabetes tend to do the worst as well, so they have worse long-term outcomes. So we thought it was particularly important to look at supplying nutritious foods in this population. Right, the boxes contained fruit and veg but also whole grains, dairy, nuts, proteins as well. I didn't manage to actually play the part but Emma was talking about just how the cost of fresh food has just really made it so difficult for her to eat healthy, even when she really wants to. Absolutely, we talk about this in terms of what we call structural barriers to healthy eating. So, again, if you think about it, our healthcare right now spends billions and billions of dollars treating what are really the downstream consequences of nutrition, so not eating a nutritious diet, and yet so little of those healthcare dollars actually flow towards subsidising and paying for the very factor that we know are driving these conditions. So really the idea of produce prescription is to try and say we should be redirecting some of that healthcare resource to enable people to eat better by actually supporting and subsidising these healthy foods. Moving away from just being altruistic or health focused, can we talk about money a bit? Did you do any modelling on what the payoff is, the cost of these boxes versus the healthcare payoff downstream? We're still at a relatively early stage in this research in Australia, but in the United States, for example, where these programs are a lot more advanced, they are already fully being reimbursed for by the California state government, for example, and the Massachusetts government, there is definitely research coming out suggesting that for every dollar that government puts into these programs, they get multiple dollars of healthcare savings back. And in some ways that's not really surprising. We know that treating diet related conditions like diabetes, like heart disease, every surgery, every medication we have to prescribe tend to cost government a lot of money. So if we were able to get people to eat better, have access to more nutritious foods, it is very likely that we could potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars in the long run. Right, so coming back to this study itself, how did you measure success over this 12-week period? So we really looked at a combination of outcomes to look at what the produce prescription helped to change. So we looked at people's diets, at how it changed over the 12 weeks, and what we found was that people ate not only more of the healthy nutritious produce of fruits and vegetables, but they also actually reduced the consumption of some of the less healthy things in their diets, things like sugary drinks, things like processed meats, and we think that that's really because of the synergy of having access to the healthy things but also having accredited dietitians who were able to work with the participants individually to say, hey, let's also think about setting some goals and reducing things, less healthy things. They also drank less alcohol, they had less alcohol consumption. Yes, that's right, so the way that we designed the dietary intervention is really around what we call diet quality, so it was not about cutting down on your calories, focusing on losing weight, because we are quite conscious that that can actually lead to a lot of stigmatisation of people thinking 'all the problem is because I'm just overweight and I don't have good willpower'. The focus is really on about changing their entire dietary pattern and we saw some really fantastic results there. So where to from here? Really I think the next step is that…this result, together with all the other research that has been done in this area, suggests that what we call produce prescription, which falls under the broader umbrella term that food is medicine, has real potential to not only improve treatment of chronic diseases but it can also make people feel better, improve overall well-being for people with diet related conditions. So what we really want to do is to scale up the sort of studies that we do and to get even better evidence, but also work together with partners across sectors, so healthcare providers, government policymakers, and also people in the food industry who really have a role to play in this in terms of supplying that healthy food, to make sure that we can actually integrate these programs into healthcare. Yes, because there isn't really a model for this so far, is that. No, that's exactly right, and in Australia right now our healthcare, when it comes to supporting people to eat better, really starts and stops at doctors, or give you a prescription to go see a dietician, they are all important things but I think these kinds of programs can and should be massively expanded, so that some of the healthcare resources actually go towards being able to prescribe healthy food. Anything that really surprised you with this study, Jason? Yeah, I guess one factor really is just how prevalent people are experiencing food insecurity is. That's not a surprise, but for us to do this study to observe that was still a bit of a shock, and in Australia, one of the richest countries on earth, but with recent Covid and the economic downturns we definitely noticed that there is a real need for these kinds of support in the community. But also the second thing was just how well the delivery program worked well for us. So, overwhelmingly the study participants told us that, look, having a box of healthy foods delivered to them, having their dietician being able to speak with them on a regular basis, the overwhelming feedback was just that they were so positive about the program and they really want to see it continue. So yes, it's a good surprise, and hopefully it bodes well for our long-term studies. Yes, we will watch with interest. Jason, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. Professor Jason Wu is head of the Nutrition Science Program at the George Institute for Global Health at the University of New South Wales. And weight loss isn't necessarily a goal for everyone, but when it is necessary it makes sense that many people would like to do it under the guidance of their GP, but this isn't an approach that is well funded in Australia at the moment. One of the people who thinks it should be is an author of a recent perspective piece in MJA Insight who joins us now. Welcome Liz Sturgiss. Hi Tegan, thanks for having me. Why are GPs the right person to be supervising weight loss attempts? Well, when people have conditions like obesity or type 2 diabetes, when reducing their weight would help their health, GPs have a holistic view of people, so we can look after anything from your mental health to your physical health and so we can kind of do it all in one package, and we really base it around the relationship between the GP and the patient. The notorious problem with weight loss is that getting it off is relatively easy but keeping it off is the real challenge. What does the evidence show actually works? Yes, so in the stories you just heard there, there's a lot of different ways to approach weight, and it has to be individualised to each person. So while a time restricted pattern might work very well for some people, other people would really benefit from, say, that provision of a healthy food box. And if your GP knows you as a person, your family, your community and what might work best for you, that's when they can give that individualised care because really anything that you do to improve your nutrition, be more physically active, it needs to be something that you can sustain so that you can maintain that better quality of health. So you were an author on a recent paper in the BMJ which was looking at people…it was mostly a UK study, but one of the things it found really was that an intensive program where you are really seeing that general practitioner again and again over months was what led to the best outcomes for people. But there's really no framework in Australia that would support that, is there. Yes, so the study showed that we needed at least 12 visits with the general practice team to make a difference for most people and their weight, and as a GP…I mean, I really feel a bit like we are working on a bit of a broken system, we don't have enough funding and enough referral pathways for patients that want to work on their weight. So if we work in, say, the chronic disease model that's funded under Medicare, you're allowed five rebateable allied health sessions a year. So compared to 12 sessions, five is probably not going to be very helpful. And then we know that a lot of…we don't have enough allied health practitioners in Australia as well and a lot of people need to pay a gap payment when they see their allied health practitioners. And then for people who need more intensive support around their weight, there is currently no medications available on the PBS to support weight, and the public system in terms of bariatric surgery, it's extremely difficult to get bariatric surgery in the public system. So really I feel like I'm working in a bit of a broken system, which is compounded because we know people in the lower socio-economic groups are more affected by obesity, so it's a real Catch-22. It's the classic thing of the people who are most in need are least likely to be able to afford it. Absolutely, and you see that in the literature and demonstrated in the data time and time again, but still our systems don't seem to be geared to putting that care in the place where it's needed the most. And just on consistency of care, we hear a lot about obesity, it's one of those things that seems to be a focal point. There was an action plan that was launched a couple of months ago, but the NHMRC clinical guidelines haven't been updated for some years and are well out of date now. Yes, I think they were rescinded in about 2013, that was when they were due to be taken back and they haven't been redone yet. So I think that would be a really excellent step in supporting weight management from primary care all the way through to secondary care, so we are all working from consistent guidelines that really have the best evidence in them. You mentioned allied health before but some people…I mean, you're saying there's not a lot of access to that often, especially in the places where it is most needed, but some people don't even have a regular GP. I think when we look at the data and ask people do they have a regular GP, some people say no to a GP but most people have a practice that they would consider their regular practice. It's really hard to get data on that. As general practice researchers we tend to say if you've seen that GP 2 to 3 times in the last 2 to 3 years then that is your regular practice, that's our standard. But that relationship based care is extremely important, and when a doctor knows you well and knows your health problems and your work and your family, they are more able to take better care of you. So I guess as a form of looking after your own health, forming a relationship with a GP who you trust and who knows you, it's a good investment in your own health. It is a bit of a wicked problem though. Where do we start in Australia to fix it? Yes, sometimes it's hard to keep hopeful but I haven't quite lost hope yet. I think having those NH&MRC clinical guidelines updated would be amazing. The National Obesity Strategy is looking amazing, it's looking a lot at the role of primary care more broadly. I was really impressed to see in those national guidelines talking about weight stigma and how we can do this in a way that's not stigmatising, and they also talk about prevention. So I think there are a few pieces falling into place but we do need more recognition of obesity as a health issue, where GPs do have a role to play, and in particular looking at access and referral pathways for people from lower socio-economic groups because if we get it right for those groups of people, everything else usually falls into place. Weight stigma is another massive topic that we will tackle another day. Liz, thanks so much for joining us. No worries, thanks Tegan. Dr Liz Sturgiss is a clinical general practitioner and senior research fellow in the School of Primary and Allied Health Care at Monash University. Everywhere you look there are issues there, it's a wicked problem, as you said, Teagan. Well, next week we continue the theme of diets and we are looking at whole plant foods versus the famous ketogenic diet and whether it's good for prevention or treatment, and the person I'm speaking to is Neil Iyengar of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York. What we see there are strong associations that have been found repeatedly across many different studies, many different populations and many different geographic regions, a strong association between higher consumption of plant-based products and lower incidence of several different cancers, predominantly cancers that are related to metabolism, like insulin levels, inflammation and so forth, and so these tend to be breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and so forth, at least 13 different cancers are metabolically mediated and have a lower incidence in populations that report higher intake of plant-based foods. And we will go on to talk about the ketogenic diet as well. I would have thought it made sense that plant-based diets would be protective. Maybe this is just an instinct, I suppose you do have to study these things as well, that that would have a better effect than the keto diet. Why do they think a keto diet could be protective? Creating metabolic stress and then there's a whole hormonal thing going on here which is that you have hormones that are related to insulin called insulin-like growth factors which are cancer promoting, and whether the ketogenic diet reduces those, and then there's the whole incidence of what happens when you've got cancer. So all that next week on the Health Report. I wouldn't miss it. Well, that's good because you're going to be here anyway. You've been listening to the Health Report with me, Norman Swan. And me, Tegan Taylor. See you next week.",1715.528,28.592133333333333,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/health-report-diet-special.mp3,/home/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/health-report-diet-special.txt,health-report-diet-special,5076,177.5313489491282
"So, are you an introvert or an extrovert? Or a bit of both? A bit of both, chuck that one in there. I like talking to people, talking to people is nice, but then also not talking to people is nice. I mean, he's not wrong. I'm an extrovert. A few weeks ago I sent producer Bel Smith down to Federation Square in Melbourne to bail up strangers and ask them questions about their personalities. And do you think being an extrovert is a good thing? What benefits does it bestow? I think being an extrovert when I was young was a real challenge because it made me think that I was a lot better than I was. It took me an extra 30 or 40 years to come to terms with how non-magnificent I am in reality. I think I'm a little bit of both. I enjoy my own company but at the same time I like being around others, I guess. Would you change anything about…would you prefer to be a bit more extroverted or a bit more introverted? I think I'm happy with the way I am, kind of, but I think it would be nice if I had…actually, no, I think I'm all right where I am. Yeah, of course you're all right, everyone's all right, nice one. This is All in the Mind , I'm Sana Qadar. And all of us fall somewhere on the spectrum between introvert and extrovert, and if you're bang in the middle, like high schooler Fiona in Fed Square, there's a word for that. Yeah, an ambivert, and this is actually where we start getting into some interesting questions about, well, what does it really mean to have a particular personality? But it's also true that people on one end of that spectrum tend to have better luck with their mental health. They report high levels of job satisfaction at work, they report high levels of life satisfaction, they report high levels of relationship satisfaction. Can you guess if it's introverts or extroverts? Today, part two of our two-parter on introversion and extroversion. Last week we focused on the story of one particular introvert who, after finding herself lonely and retreating from the world, decided to push against her nature and try to become more extroverted. I've always felt this shyness and I just didn't want it to hold me back in life. Today we are going to explore what science and psychology tell us about these traits, how much genes and gender play a role, whether extroversion is a necessary trait for leadership, and the surprising way the brains of introverts and extroverts are different. All right, I'll get you to start by just introducing yourself, so your name, what you do, and where. My name is Andrew Spark, I'm a personality scientist at the School of Management at the Queensland University of Technology. Do you count yourself as an extrovert or an introvert? No, I'm pretty much a bona fide introvert because extroversion is pretty much a continuum and I sit somewhere down like the 10th percentile, so I'm pretty introverted. So, you know, coming on national radio and podcast and whatnot is not my natural element, but it's good fun, nonetheless. You're sounding pretty good anyway, so you're hiding it well. And how do you even know that you are the bottom 10%, how do you measure that? So basically when we're looking at measuring human personality, the dominant model is pretty much known as the big five or the five factor model. The five factor model of personality. We've covered this plenty of times previously on All in the Mind but here's a quick recap if you are hearing about this for the first time. The big five personality traits are openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism, and we all score high or low or somewhere in the middle for each of these. There is also a sixth model which includes another factor called honesty or humility. So basically more or less all humans across the globe vary on these five dimensions, and generally the way it's measured is usually with a self-report questionnaire, so where people answer questions about themselves, but you can also do it where you actually get a person who knows you well to describe you as well, and you actually find that there is quite a lot of convergence between those two forms of measurement, so those are the main ways of measuring personality. So basically then it's a case of saying, okay, compared to everyone else who completes these personality questionnaires, you can score someone in terms of their raw score of extroversion, and for me, mine happens to be pretty low and so I can compare myself and find that basically 90% of people more or less have higher extroversion scores than I do. But Andrew says most people are actually ambiverts, somewhere in the middle. That's right, and what I'm interested in looking at in particular is how people actually behave. So it may be that yes, someone might be really highly extroverted, but the evidence shows that we actually all enact behaviours across the range of that continuum. So even though I'm an introvert, there will be times, depending on the demands of the situation, where I will have to engage in more extroverted behaviours. And equally, an extrovert who…let's say they are in a movie theatre and maybe it's not the best place to be engaging in extroverted behaviours, they will have to enact more introverted behaviours. So there are social and situational demands that shape our behaviour, but nevertheless, depending on where we are at a trait level will guide what behaviours we naturally want to engage in more often. And where did these tendencies or traits come from? Is it a genetic thing? Is it just a matter of personality, where does it come from? With respect to the big five, there's been quite a bit of work done on looking at the genetic origins of personality, and what we find is that around about roughly 40% to 50% of our adult personality comes from genes, so that is to say that roughly half of our personality is determined by our genes. But that still means that there is about 50% to 60% of our personality that is determined by nongenetic factors. And when scientists have looked into this, the obvious place to look would be, okay, the home, your family life, your home life, your parents in terms of how they raised you and all of that sort of stuff. And the really bizarre thing…and this is something that when I came across these findings, even as a parent, made me go, oh really, is that actually true? We found that parents actually make basically no contribution to the personality of their children beyond their genetic contribution. I should clarify, they do make a contribution to the personality of the child but once the child grows up and becomes an adult, those effects largely disappear. And so the question is, well, where do those effects come from, the environmental effects? And the answer is we don't really know. Aside from pretty extreme nasty environments where children might be abused and all that sort of stuff, that's different, that does create personality differences, but hopefully for a healthy, normal environment, most of that environmental stuff seems to come from idiosyncratic, random experiences that we've had that are really actually hard to study systematically. Just the soup of being human and living on this planet. Yes, basically, and the noise that we all experience, do you know what I mean? Yep. And in terms of the people who are true introverts or extroverts, that sit at the extremes of the spectrum that you spoke about, is it true that their brains are different? Yeah, they are. So there's been quite a bit of neuroscience work that has looked at…particularly there is a neurotransmitter, and a neurotransmitter is essentially like a chemical that's in the brain that helps the brain signal to other parts of the brain, and they facilitate that transmission of information. And dopamine is the neurotransmitter that has been largely linked with extroversion, although it's not just linked with extroversion, it's linked with some other personality traits as well. And there is a system in the brain which technically is called the dopaminergic system. An easier term is just simply the reward circuit. What this system does is it basically wires us to not only pay attention to interesting, rewarding things in our environment, but it also makes us want to approach them and seek them out. And so what happens is that in extroverts' brains, it seems to be the case that they have more of this bursting effect of dopamine inside as part of the dopaminergic system, and what that means is that extroverts seem to be more sensitive to reward cues in the environment, and an obvious reward cue for humans, for the most part, is social interaction. And so that seems to be where the social interaction reward element for extroverts comes from, at least from a neuroscience perspective, whereas introverts don't have as much of that response. Right, okay, so I consider myself an extrovert, does that mean I have more dopamine coursing through my brain or I'm just more responsive to the dopamine hit that social attraction would give me? It can be both. So it can be not only just the amount of dopamine that's released but also the number of dopamine receptors that actually respond to the dopamine that is released. And so overall you can say that extroverts have a greater sensitivity just in general to that overall phenomenon. That said, there is a bursting effect that occurs when we experience a reward that is of interest to us. And so what that means is that right at the top of the brainstem there are dopamine-releasing cells that literally burst out dopamine and that can happen more so in extroverts simply because they have more of that sensitivity to a rewarding stimuli and environment. That is usually social but it's not always social. We find that extroverts experience a higher level of reward sensitivity just in general as well. That's an interesting term to use, 'bursting', because it makes me think about how I am in social situations where I feel like I'm on a high, I'm really loving what's going on, I'm loving the party, I feel on a different plane, like I have this burst of excitement and happiness. Does that translate to the emotional experience? For sure, absolutely, that's a really good anecdote, that experience, because that aligns pretty well with what we find in extroverts. So if we want to break out extroversion into its aspects of extroversion that we can look at as well and they break out into two main parts, one is enthusiasm and one is assertiveness, and so for someone who was really high in extroversion they will probably be high in both of those aspects, those two aspects are related to each other, but they are different enough that we can actually measure them separately. So enthusiasm is just that raw sense of fun and joy and that's what it says on the box basically, it's enthusiasm, whereas assertiveness is a little bit more of a sense of confidence and social potency, and that seems to be perhaps where a leadership element comes into it, the sort of desire to perhaps take the reins and take charge, particularly in the presence of other people. But they are related, those two things. This is so interesting because this, for the first time ever, explains to me why I am the way I am. I have the enthusiasm but I don't have the assertiveness, I shy away from making first contact in social situations, I'm quite nervous initially until someone comes out to me and then I'm all in, and that has been the case across all sorts of situations, in work and elsewhere, that I'm not as assertive as I should be for my extroversion. Yeah, that's fascinating. So we do find…and this is a generalisation, and the effects aren't huge but they are there, that for the most part there is not that much difference between men and women in terms of their overall level of extroversion. Women are very slightly more extroverted but there's not much in it really. However, when we start looking at the enthusiasm and assertiveness side, we do see gender differences there, whereby men are more likely to be assertive and lower in enthusiasm, whereas with women it's the other way around. And so that is a relatively common experience for many women to say, yes, I'm pretty extroverted but I don't perhaps feel as confident with the assertiveness side of things, and that can be a common thing that many women talk about. Coming back to what we were talking about with dopamine and what's going on in the brains of introverts versus extroverts, we've talked about what's happening with extroverts, with introverts, are they just not getting the dopamine hit and that's why they don't like social interaction, or do they actively dislike it for broader reasons than that? Yes, that's interesting. So there certainly seems to be that neuroscientific evidence with respect to essentially the lower level of bursting in the dopaminergic system. I will actually say, just as a slight tangent to that, though it's related, is that…so, when someone experiences depression, there is a distinct lack of dopaminergic activity. It's almost as if…and I don't think I'm out of line by using this analogy, but it's almost as if the dopaminergic system is somewhat infected. It's like the person just doesn't have any motivational force whatsoever and it's really hard for them to motivate themselves because that system just isn't working properly. So that's a pretty extreme case. But with introverts, introverts are slightly more susceptible to experiencing depression than extroverts, though most of the predictive power in terms of personality predicting depression actually comes from what's called trait neuroticism which is where sensitivity to negative emotion sits. So on the introversion side it's true that introverts don't experience as much of that dopaminergic hit, they will tell you that they just simply don't have the same positive emotion response in the presence of rewarding stimuli. There is also a cognitive element to this, or you can think of it like a thinking element, that my colleagues and I, Professor Peter O'Connor and I have looked at, as well as other scholars. So what we did is we looked at trying to see how extroverts and introverts think about a future social situation. So we said, okay, we've got a whole bunch of introverts and extroverts together and we said you're going to engage in a social situation, how do you feel about that? How do you think you will feel about that? Do you think that you will like it, do you think that you will not like it? And what we found is that introverts felt kind of a bit 'meh' about it, to be honest, they felt like they probably wouldn't really enjoy that social situation and they also felt like it was not something that they were particularly motivated to do, whereas the extroverts were just, like, yeah, let me at it, I want to get stuck in to that, that sounds fantastic. And so to answer your question, there is a slight elevation in the expectation that future social situations won't be enjoyable for introverts, that extroverts just generally don't have as much. Trait neuroticism also plays a part in that though, so participants who were more sensitive to negative emotion, that's where anxiety mostly sits, they also experienced a little bit more negative emotion when they thought about this future social situation. But what's interesting is that some of the work that's been done on these…they are called affective forecasts, forecasting your emotion, is that they found that introverts actually under-predict how much they will like those situations. So they think that the social situation and acting extroverted won't be much fun but when they actually do it they find that the extroverted behaviour is actually a lot more fun than they thought, and so that leads to an affective forecasting error that introverts are far more likely to engage in, particularly with regards to acting extroverted. If you listen to last week's part one episode on introversion and extroversion, this might sound familiar. It's basically author Jessica Pan's story, and the title of her book sums this attitude up perfectly, it's called Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come . That makes sense. It's something that I suppose anecdotally I can speak to as an introvert, it's something that is a challenge to overcome sometimes because, okay, we know that extroverts do experience more positive emotion and that's in part because of that reward circuit, extroverts feel excitement more readily. But what's interesting is that it seems to be that extroverted behaviour in and of itself is causally related or causes an increase in positive emotion, so that's really interesting. So then the question is, well, what happens though for introverts who do this often, because a lot of the pushback that I've got is, again, from introverts saying no, when I act like an extrovert, I feel really exhausted, I don't want to do that. And there has been some evidence that has looked at that and has found that it's true, people do experience tiredness, and that tiredness kicks in around about three hours later, funnily enough, but that tiredness seems to be true for extroverts as well. So yes, introverts do experience tiredness after acting extroverted, but actually so do extroverts because acting extroverted is usually a higher-energy set of behaviours. I just want to dig into this a bit more because it's really fascinating to me. Given all of that, are extroverts generally happier than introverts? Is extroversion a necessary ingredient for happiness? That's a good question. So I would say no, extroversion isn't a necessary ingredient for happiness. Nevertheless, it is true that extroverts do report higher levels of well-being more generally, psychological well-being. So, for example, they report high levels of job satisfaction at work, they report high levels of life satisfaction, they report high levels of relationship satisfaction, they report high levels of general vitality. So there is something core to extroversion which is wrapped up with essentially positive emotion. But there are a couple of things I would say to that. One is that it's probabilistic, not deterministic, that's a term that I like because it reminds us that your personality doesn't determine everything about who you are, far from it. And so even though, yes, extroverts might have this natural advantage to experiencing higher levels of well-being, that doesn't mean that introverts can't, not at all, there are plenty of happy introverts that have found their happy place in life, whatever that may be, things that they do in life, whether it's focusing on their family, it might be a career that they really love or a hobby, whatever it may be, where they derive an immense amount of joy and happiness. And so that's just as well, otherwise I certainly wouldn't like personality to be that deterministic, I think that would be pretty sad. This is All in the Mind , I'm Sana Qadar. Today, part two of our two-parter on introversion and extroversion, and I'm chatting to Dr Andrew Spark, a personality scientist at the Queensland University of Technology. We talked about all these reasons why introverts might want to adopt a bit more extroversion and the benefits of that. Is there any reason for extroverts to want to be a bit more introverted? Is there any benefit for going the other way? There are, but there are some potential costs to that as well which we are only really now starting to uncover. So the one thing that is often a complaint, and don't cut my head off when I say this, the one thing that is often a complaint when interacting with extroverts is that they can sometimes be more likely to interrupt and perhaps to take over the conversation. I can't believe you say that! I know, I'm terrible, aren't I! So, that can be something whereby perhaps…I've got a good friend of mine who I work with, he's brilliant, he's so extroverted, he's a great guy, and what he does, he's well aware of this, he works with personality as well, what he does is when we are having a Zoom conversation, he will deliberately mute his mike so that he doesn't interrupt me, and that's something that he has put in place for himself because he's aware that he has that tendency. And so that's something that the extroverts might sometimes struggle with because it's just that raw enthusiasm to get stuck in and social, it's like trying to hold yourself back from that can be really hard, and some of the evidence that we are uncovering now shows that that is actually genuinely harder for extroverts to do, and there may well be some well-being consequences to that. But that said, if you think of all the different situations that we have in life, some of those situations demand more extroversion, some of those situations demand more introversion, and it's a case of trying to better align our behaviour with the demands of this situation, and that's a challenge for everyone across the continuum. What if the situation demands leadership? Andrew says extroversion isn't a necessary ingredient for happiness, thankfully, but is it a necessary ingredient for leadership? Well, his own research has confirmed what we kind of instinctively can guess is the case, that most people generally view extroverts as naturally inclined to leadership roles and better at them. But he's had some surprising findings too. In a recent series of experiments, he and his colleagues had about 600 people, a mix of introverts and extroverts, take part in a problem-solving activity. They did this in smaller groups of three or four people. The scenario was that they had to imagine that they crash-landed on the Moon and they had to solve a survival problem. And we deliberately selected that because we didn't want anyone to have any experience with that sort of thing. In some of these groups, one person was instructed beforehand to act extroverted—assertive, talkative, and enthusiastic—but the other members of the group didn't know they'd been told this. In other cases, someone was secretly told to act introverted. And in a third setting, no one was given any instructions, so everyone was free to act as they naturally would. And what we found out of that was that in the acted extroverted condition, so looking at those actors who had had to act extroverted, we found that those people were in fact seen to be more leader-like than everyone else in the group. And what was interesting there though is that that was true even for the introverts. So the introverts who engaged in these extroverted behaviours were seen to be leader-like, people thought they were pretty good leaders. And not only that, they also thought pretty highly of their own leadership potential, so it was kind of like a nice boost in confidence, in a way. And so that wasn't I guess the case in the other groups really. No, that's right. So in the introverted group we found that, sure enough, those people who acted introverted were not really seen as being particularly great leaders but it wasn't just that, we found…and this was a whopping effect that we did not expect, is that people's own perception of their leadership capability really took a nosedive, and that was true for introverts and extroverts, so people who engaged in introverted behaviour in the social situation, really thought quite low of their own leadership capability. Now, our data can't tell us precisely why that is but we do have a speculation. We think that that's probably because when you are acting introverted in a social situation, we think that that makes you withdraw into yourself a little bit more, and you become essentially more self-conscious, whereas the other people in the group are kind of busy doing their thing, they are busy talking and solving problems and all that, probably not focused on you that much, whereas you become more focused on yourself and you sort of think quite lowly of yourself, that's what we think is happening. That's really interesting. And I guess all of this feels like a real indictment of introversion for anyone who wants to get ahead in the working world. It is that sort of the lesson that comes out of this? No, it isn't, there are a couple of lessons. One thing I'll say before I'll talk about that in a bit more detail is…so that was looking at the leadership emergent potential, and what we also looked at was how people felt, positive and negative emotion. We actually found that the introverts who acted extroverted and the introverts who acted introverted actually felt okay, they didn't experience any change in their positive emotion or their negative emotion. But it was quite different for the extroverts, so the extroverts who acted extroverted, they were fine, no problem there, but the extroverts who acted introverted, they hated it. They experienced a massive decline in positive emotion and a large increase in negative emotion, so much so that we even got comments that were volunteered by these participants , from the extroverts, who said, 'Never make me act like an introvert again, I hated that activity, I never want to do that activity again.' So acting introverted for the extroverts was really not very pleasant for them. To answer your question though in terms of, well, does this look bad for the introverts; not necessarily. So there are a couple of things here. The first thing is that there is a choice that introverts have. In some ways there may even be more behavioural flexibility for introverts, in the sense that, like I mentioned, that extroverts kind of struggled to act like introverts, it didn't seem to go too well for them. Introverts could kind of adapt to either behavioural strategy when asked to. So what that points to is actually perhaps a surprising behavioural flexibility that introverts have to adapt their behaviour if they want to. If they want to do that, they can do that if they want. So I get some pushback, I've had emails in my inbox from people, from introverts telling me that I shouldn't pursue my line of research because I'm telling introverts to act like extroverts, and as a consequence it's as if I'm telling them that they shouldn't be true to who they are, and I get that argument but I don't entirely agree with it because the point of a lot of this sort of research is to say, hey look, we actually have a lot more behavioural flexibility than what we might think. Introverts are capable of acting like extroverts when it's appropriate to do so, and it appears as though there are not too many negative consequences of doing so. And so therefore you have the option, the agency essentially, to decide for yourself if that sort of behaviour is going to be useful to you, and if it's not, hey, that's cool, that's fine with me. There is also evidence that whether an extrovert or an introvert is effective in their role as a leader actually comes down to the kind of team they are leading. There is some work by Professor Adam Grant that's really cool… Professor Grant teaches at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. What he was looking at was reversing the extroverted leadership advantage, and what he did is he found that whether or not the leader is affected actually depends on the kind of team that they are leading. And what he found is that introverts who led proactive teams, teams that have a lot of get up and go and they are pretty self-motivated, they actually do better when they are led by introverts because what happens is introverts are more likely to just provide the direction and just let them go, whereas an extrovert is more likely to want to take over and… Micromanage. Yes, and sort of stifle some of their proactiveness. However, where the extroverts were particularly effective was where they were not leading a proactive team and maybe the team needed a bit of a kick up the backside, and extroverts were fantastic at that. And so there are these situational dependencies as well that shape whether or not extraversion or introversion is more beneficial. So although I talk about the generalisations, there are so many complexities and nuances that we are trying to now uncover which I think are really important to add flavour to the overall story. Okay, so I guess the summary version is no one is terrible, there are benefits to both, but there could be potentially more benefits if you go adopting a bit more extraversion. That's right, on average I would say that's a fair summary. Right, okay, nice. That's Dr Andrew Spark, personality scientist from the Queensland University of Technology. Are you an introvert or an extrovert? And a big thank you to producer Bel Smith for heading down to Federation Square in Melbourne, stopping strangers and chatting about their personalities. Thankfully she counts herself as an ambivert, so it wasn't totally the scariest assignment. I'm happy to have my own space and not be part of bigger crowds and things like that. So being in Fed Square is not your idea of a good time? It's nice and quiet today, so I'm alright with that, yeah. Thanks also to producer James Bullen and sound engineer Nathan Turnbull.

"One of the common questions that Tegan and I get about Covid is why there's so much variation in how people respond to the infection. One answer is in your genes, and there is a massive ongoing study into comparing people's genomes with how COVID-19 has affected them. Dr Gita Pathak is a team leader in what's called the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Gita is based at Yale University's School of Medicine in the United States. Thank you for inviting me, I really appreciate it. So you're not mapping the virus here, you're mapping the people who were infected with the virus to see what happens to them and whether there are specific genes involved in their experience of the virus. That is correct. The goal of the study is to understand human genetics response to the viral infection which we know as COVID-19. We wanted to look at three different outcomes of COVID-19, specifically people who were critically ill from Covid, then people who were hospitalised due to Covid, and people who tested positive for Covid, so the least severe of the three definitions, and which genes might be associated with these three outcomes. And how many genomes have you managed to test? 60 studies from 25 countries, and that resulted in close to 3 million individuals' genetic profiles, and we found a total of 23 genes that show an association with COVID-19. So, let's take severity, and this is in a European population, by and large, a Caucasian population. Have you found any consistency in genes for severe disease? Yes, so genetic ancestry is different than what someone may identify themselves as, like ethnically or geographically. Mostly we do have genetic ancestry of the European descent, but we also had people who are genetically South Asian, East Asian, African ancestry, and that separate from where they are geographically or what they identify as. So this is a bit like 23andMe or Ancestry.com where you send off your genes and you find out that you are 50% Greek and you didn't think you were 50% Greek. Correct. When we are looking at genetic profiles, it's really important to adjust for genetic ancestry and not specifically for what somebody identifies as. Some genetic variation is more common in one ancestry over others, and if we include people from these diverse ancestries, we can pick up these signals much more quickly… So, for example, it was said in the early part of the pandemic that people of South Asian origin had more severe disease and a higher risk of death. Did that pan out in your study? We did find one of the genetic variants that was more common in South Asian populations relative to other populations, but that is just one variant. Genes tend to perform in a similar way across ancestries. They may vary based on their frequency in different ancestries, and that information helps us capture why one ancestry might be exhibiting a higher response or a softer response, but by and large all the genes we saw, they tend to have a similar effect across all ancestries. And what with these genes doing to increase your vulnerability to severe disease? Some of the genes that we found were related to different lung functions. So, for example, we found something called SFTPD which is a lung surfactant protein, and it has already been known to be associated with different pulmonary functions, and there are other studies which have shown that this specific gene has been known with respiratory distress syndrome in different populations. And just to explain, surfactant is the fluid, if you like, that lines the tubes of your lungs and keeps them open, and it's what is deficient in premature babies, causing the respiratory disease of the premature baby. So, in other words, a deficiency of this in adults may predispose you, unsurprisingly, to severe disease. The question of course on everybody's lips now is why do some people not seem to catch COVID-19? There's a group of people who appear anecdotally to be resistant. Did you find COVID-19 resistance genes? Not in our work. Depending on how we look at the variant, the varients we find are associated with the COVID-19 outcome, but if there are people who may be on the opposite spectrum of these, so let's say who are not carriers of this, they might be generally resistant to Covid but that specific study we haven't performed, but that's a good question for later. And just finally, any therapeutic insights that might direct people towards more effective medications to treat people who've got Covid, or prevent it getting worse? One good thing that we understand from this work is that we now have a good number of genes to specifically focus our efforts into, and now this can lead to efforts of drug repurposing or drug development. Did we find a specific drug? No, but we definitely found several targets that now could be investigated for different drugs. Gita, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me, I really appreciate it.

"Dung beetles. We have many, but we need more it seems. Here's an extract from one of my favourite ABC programs from a couple of weeks ago, Country Breakfast on RN. So we're looking for a cow pat with a little bit of dirt that has come up through it… At a farm on Far North Queensland's Atherton Tablelands, these people are behaving in a rather strange way. They are searching through piles of cattle dung and looking for a little animal that has one of the most unappealing and yet important jobs in the world; eating animal droppings. Dr Bernard Doube is the world's leading ecologist specialising in studying this small and misunderstood creature. This is a beetle that comes from the high rainfall districts of eastern Africa and we introduced it about 30 years ago and it's got a very restricted distribution up here on the Atherton and hardly anywhere else in Australia. But up here it's doing a great job. It digs a tunnel to about 20 centimetres, something like that, lines the tunnel with dung and so the earthworms that are here, they go down feeding on the dung that's lining the tunnel, and then down below the beetle puts perhaps half a litre of dung, something like that, a huge amount really, and lays a whole lot of eggs in it, the eggs hatch into larvae, the larvae then eat all of the dung, the adult beetles feed on the dung juices and the larvae feed on the dung fibre. And so then the larvae crap out this processed stuff, which is rather like compost. And so down at 20 centimetres you've now got earthworm casts and down below you've got a great big pile of plant nutrients ready, and so the roots grow down there, and so you get increased production and increased carbon storage because it's a relatively permanent change in the structure of the soil. So the dung beetles are of great benefit in terms of increasing the permeability of the soil to moisture. But up here the water goes straight in. So the primary benefits are to get the dung underground, stop pasture fouling, and also then to increase the subsoil fertility of the region, and so this will last us quite some years, and so over time the whole pasture will be processed by dung beetle activity, and our experiments from southern Australia indicate that we get about a 30% increase in productivity due to the dung burial activity of the beetles. Dr Bernard Doube on Country Breakfast , RN. And so to a newcomer. CSIRO in Canberra are importing a fresh visitor, and Dr Valerie Caron is in charge of this servant of Sisyphus. My first question is this; we've got about 500 native dung beetles in Australia, they've been here for squillions of years, why do we need to import more, as we did some time ago? You are right, we have amazing dung beetles that are native to Australia and we do have 500 species. The only issue with these amazing creatures is that they coevolved with native fauna, they have coevolved with them. So they are very much used to that kind of dung, kind of dry, fibrous dung produced by kangaroos and wombats and all that. So when Europeans brought those cows and sheep, they produce a lot of dung, those beetles could not deal with it, so they could not use that dung and it just accumulated on the soil surface and that has a lot of negative impact. So that's why we bring dung beetles from other countries, so we bring dung beetles that can deal with that cattle and sheep dung. And how many have been brought so far? So we are at 44 species now, so that's quite a lot of species but that's in over 60 years, it's a very long program. So during this program that we are doing now, we are bringing three new ones. From Morocco. Yes, they are coming from Morocco, for various reasons. So we are trying to really focus on southern Australia and spring dung beetles that we are looking for. So Morocco has an amazing diversity of dung beetles, they have a lot of cattle, they have a lot of herds, they have a very high population of dung beetles compared to other countries. I thought for one minute you were going to talk about how we need to have dung beetles for camel dung. We have camels too! Actually, camels are an invasive species in Australia and they produce a copious amount of dung, but we are not focusing on that at the moment. Morocco has a very diverse climate, which is very interesting because they do have mountains, they are bordered by sea, bordered by desert on the other side, so they have very varied climate, which is actually quite useful for us when we are looking for dung beetles that would thrive in Australia. And what sort of dung are they after when you let them loose? Cattle and sheep mostly. The area where we go in Morocco, it's where there are big herds of cows and mostly sheep and goats, and there is always a donkey. Yes, sure, always a donkey, but surely to cover that we've already got various imported dung beetles, even for South Australia, to look after that problem. What need is there for these new ones? So we do have 44 species that were introduced, 23 have established, so they are doing a great job. But each dung beetle has an activity window, they are not active all year round, and what we want is dung beetles that actually…when they're active and they take the dung down to the soil. So we don't want the dung to stay on the surface. So those species of beetles are great, but there are still some gaps. So we've got gaps in season and we have geographical gaps as well. What we are focusing on now is on the gap in spring that is all over southern Australia, so we are talking about WA all the way to Tasmania and New South Wales. So we are really covering a large area. So in early spring there are not enough dung beetles doing the job, and then the dung just accumulates on the soil surface and it causes a lot of different problems, it spoils pasture, accumulation of dung, if there is a flood it will go in the waterways and then can cause water pollution. And also one of the main things I think that all Australians care about is the bush flies that are very annoying, they actually spread and grow in dung. So if you have a lot of dung on a surface, you provide a lot of habitat for those flies to thrive and then you can get these crazy populations of flies. They are just very annoying, they don't bite but they are still really, really difficult to deal with. Yes, that was the main reason, way back in the beginning, that an awful lot of people…the corks on your brimmed hat weren't enough to keep them away and so people just got terribly fed up…and this brilliant idea. But tell me, when these dung beetles…we've all seen films of them, a bit like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the mountain forever, they of course are rolling, these dung beetles, this beautiful work of the round pieces of dung which they're pushing towards presumably their burrows. Yes, so it's interesting because we always think about the dung beetle that rolls the ball, in fact at the moment we only have two species that are established that are rollers, all the other ones are tunnellers. So what they do is they make little tunnels under the dung pad and then they will take the dung down, make a little ball, and that's where they actually lay their eggs, so they need to take out that dung to provide resources for their developing larvae. So the roller, we only have two species, we just imported a new one that actually is a roller as well, they are amazing and we see them even climbing walls of cages. They are actually really good at rolling that ball if they really want to go. You really love these creatures, don't you, and the dung, you're a coprologist. Well, let's say I'm working on the beetles than the actual dung, but they are really fascinating creatures, and what I find the most interesting is that each species has their own little quirks and their own behaviour and they are all quite different, and that, as a scientist, is the most fascinating thing. Have you done much, by the way…the problem that most people have in science who are importing new species is to make sure that they don't disturb the ecology when they turn up in surprising ways. Yes, that's actually one of the main things that we have to do and we are very, very careful with that, so it's very hard to introduce anything in Australia and we should be very proud of our biosecurity policies and all the people that keep our borders safe, actually. So when we introduced dung beetles it was a very long process for people to actually accept dung beetles to be imported, so we have a special permit for that. There was a big risk assessment that was done as well by the Department of Environment then. And also when we bring dung beetles in we bring adults, so they are collected from the field in Morocco, they are then cleaned, identified, starved, sent to a laboratory in France because we have CSIRO's laboratory in southern France. Then they are again fed maybe for a little while but they will be cleaned again. We have to remove any little organism that could be on them because little things hitchhike on dung beetles, little mites for example. And then they will be cleaned again, starved and then sent to Australia. They will only be kept in a quarantine facility, which is actually at Black Mountain. We receive the adults, we again clean them just to make sure they are fine, we feed them because they are very hungry by that stage, and that's where we breed them. But the only thing we can take out of quarantine are their eggs, and the eggs have been surface-sterilised, so there is absolutely nasty that can come out. So the eggs are squeaky-clean, no viruses, no nematodes, nothing that can be on them, then we take them out and then we can rear them, which is incredible that it's working really because it's a very harsh chemical we are using on them. Very reassuring. By the way, you mentioned mites, of course we are terribly worried about mites at the moment in regard to bees, aren't we. Yes, so a different type of mites, there is such a diversity of mites in the world. Dung is actually an ecosystem, there are so many things living in dung, which I find really impressive, but yes, there are little mites that will be in the dung, and what they do is that they actually hitchhike on the dung beetles. So when they want to move pad, instead of moving themselves, they are little, they can't fly, they will just hop on the dung beetle and then the dung beetle will take them somewhere else. So we make sure we don't bring those in the country, and even if they were coming to quarantine, they can't come out of quarantine anyway, so it's very, very safe. So, very different from the varroa mite, it's a very big problem on bees. Very reassuring, given the precautions that you mentioned. My final question to you, you come from Canada, from Québec, how is it that you are transferred to such an Australian measure? I can imagine it's a bit too snowy and icy in parts of Canada to have dung beetles, the poor things. But thank you so much, Valerie. Thank you so much.

"A few months ago I was struck, as were hundreds of visitors to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, by an exhibition of artistic works based on recovered materials, and little did I know then that lots of the work was inspired by research at the University of Technology in Sydney on using similar unusual sources to make buildings and refashion them. And so I met Professor Tim Schork. Where are we? You said this is where the magic happens. What kind of magic? All sorts of magic. As you can see, we have facilities like a large robot and also smaller robots, we have CNC equipment, and the magic that happens here is that we experimentally explore new building processes but also new materials, and we both built the hardware and software where we bring together interdisciplinary knowledge from different fields and work actively with industry partners on projects. And on the bench here you have a gigantic roll of what looks like some sort of plastic wrapper. What is it? Yes, it is indeed plastic, it's one of the prototypes, if you can look at it, all those little wrinkles are actually pores within that long extrusion and it's printed out of recycled plastic, in particular wrapping or for medical devices, I think it's quite a common material there. But we don't actually in Australia look into the circular economy and life-cycle of this material, so this is one of the aspects the project did, to look into industrial waste streams and how can we use those in the built environment. And how it's made, is it 3D printed with a robot and it's actually an extrusion, so the robot prints layer by layer and then accelerates in order to introduce the pores which is key to the project because we all know air-conditioning, it's something that we feel actually quite uncomfortable with, we get all this air dumped on us, it's not a really pleasant environment. The project really looked at how can we redesign a system for existing office buildings. It's also quite important to note that a lot of building works actually happens actually happens in the refurbishment buildings, we don't really build so many new buildings in Australia, so adaptive reuse. And how we can think about bringing air much better actually into the space, you know, something that is diffuse rather than these really cold dumps of air that make us all uncomfortable. Now, you've also got lots of chunks of very nice wood, it looks almost like cake, it's beautifully made and put together with different layers, different colours. Yes, we work across a series of different building materials, we certainly work with timber as well, we are fortunate enough to have recently been funded by the Australian Research Council on a project that is led by the University of Queensland, a research hub around how to uptake timber in Australia. But we also certainly work on how to reduce the embodied carbon also when it comes to concrete. We now have expertise and techniques that we can reduce how much concrete we use. We certainly will need to continue building with concrete. Not everything can be made out of timber or biomaterials. But we are working on this with colleagues in engineering as well, in order to try to use less but use it smartly. I mean, the greatest invention is still opening a window, but that's not always possible. No, I know, they lock them all! Well, they lock them all for all sorts of reasons. I mean, one of the reasons as well is not just around safety but actually people sometimes just open the window at the wrong time and therefore their entire HVAC system needs to work even harder rather than maintaining temperature. Certainly as a German we know what cross ventilation is, but there is a lot of work saying…you know, you mentioned before timber and other things where we can actually look into new ways to design, we can also look at biological systems and other fields of knowledge that can assist us how we can just basically designed and also feel smarter. Have you had anything to do with the green building just across the road from the university here? Not in the design, I certainly go there sometimes. But we had something to do with that, together with a colleague, Sara Wilkinson, and another company, where we developed, thanks to the City of Sydney, to look at a façade inspection, where we were able to actually help in maintaining the green building façade, which is a very important thing for biodiversity and microclimate within a city, but the very big challenge around it is actually how to maintain this. So we worked on a project like that with colleagues in engineering, our robotics group over there, so we had a very, very close look at that. Have they been able to solve many of the problems that have arisen? I'm not too sure if they solved all of the problems, but it certainly has been a very tough couple of years also around climate around this as well and the kind of replacement of those planter boxes, and this is why we do this research, we know that we have a global climate crisis that we need to address this and we need to do this at all ends. And my final question, we both know somebody called Robbie who lives in Balmain and I was introduced to her because she was looking after a project connected with the Royal Botanic Gardens where people were making displays and art out of recycled material. That was part of an exhibition earlier this year. That's how we met. Thanks to Robbie and a big shout-out to her, a really lovely person. It was a great exhibition, Transformation, at the Friends of the Botanic Gardens over there, you can actually see those 3D printed coloured objects which were done by students. I mentioned before that we certainly do a lot of research here but this space is also used by students because our main aim is to educate the next generation of designers, of architects. Yes, it was fantastic and a really wonderful exhibition and they are certainly doing some great work there. So there we have engineers, botanists, architects, artists, all working together in various ways, as Tim Schork, Associate Professor in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney described. And of course, all green buildings require adjustment as they grow and experiment. Close to his lab full of robots and 3D plastics redeployed, giving a smoother air conditioning, is another lab, containing Kate Scardifield. We are sitting in the Material Ecologies Design Lab in the Faculty of Design, Architecture and Building at UTS. And there are all sorts of things on your very long table, and they look vaguely organic, and I know of course the source of many of them, but one of them looks almost like a sort of nut log that you could chomp. What is it? Some of them do look a little bit edible. I wouldn't bite into them. We've got a whole range of different materials in development in this space, so the Materials Ecologies Design Lab, or MEDL as it's very affectionately known, is a kind of lab-come-studio-come-kitchen space for materials experimentation and design, and it hosts a range of different research products that intersect with science and engineering and architecture. And I guess the underlying thematic for the group of researchers working in here is to think about what a shift away from fossil derived materials towards bio-based regenerative and reparative materials might look like. Well, of course your university I know well because I saw it being built, mainly of concrete, which is famously…you know, CO 2 everywhere. Absolutely. I mean, the building industry remains one of the most polluting industries globally, it's responsible for a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions, it's incredibly energy intensive the way that we build, with steel, with glass. So, some of the material investigations and the research that's happening in this space are trying to think through materials for application in building and construction, that's what I've been focused on most recently. And famously including seaweed. Yes, I have been working with seaweed now for nearly two years. I'm working really closely with a group of marine scientists and biochemists and we've been looking at ways in which we can use seaweed derived products to create more sustainable material solutions for the future. Well, of course the first instinct is that there is lots of seaweed that might be, like kelp, quite robust, but it's still sloshy. How do you make it firm and buildable? So, seaweed and the macroalgae that we've been using is seaweed that has been grown for water remediation, so it is already actually attached to existing aquaculture systems where it's cleaning and filtering water, and because seaweed thrives on sunlight and nitrogen and it grows really exponentially and fast, it produces a huge amount of biomass. And so the work that I've been doing is looking at ways in which we might utilise that biomass as a carbon sink and then think about transforming that into materials that we could stick into buildings and hopefully take out of circulation for a while. And so these rather large nutty, brownish, elegant…you're actually going for one of the ones which isn't formed, it's just like a great big lump of stone really. It does look like stone, doesn't it. The first time I saw it, it reminded me of a kind of volcanic rock. And so this is how it dries naturally, if you harvest it, press it and then just let it sun-dry, it dries incredibly hard and quite gnarly and rocklike, like this. So what I've been trying to do is look at different systems for controlling the drying process and then combining that with different binders and different fillers in order to produce these kind of brick-like forms that hopefully are on their way to some mechanical testing processes. Yes, the one you're actually touching there is at least half a metre and got some elegant almost sculpture-like holes through it, and it's solid as, well, a rock, and is that seaweed as well? It is, it's a combination of seaweed biomass and oyster shell waste. So I've been working with Appellation Oysters who are a really fantastic co-op that represent a number of the New South Wales oyster farms, and looking at sourcing some of their shell waste when it arrives, and then integrating that into this mix with the algae. Oyster shells are full of calcium carbonate and they are incredibly strong, so part of this project was looking at ways in which we could create a composite with those two materials. I really like the kind of relationship they also have, they are part of a marine ecology, they speak to maritime histories but they are also both filtration devices, they're bivalves. Did you say appellation? Appellation Oysters. You don't get them from Appalachia? No, I don't, most of the shells that are pressed into these bricks have come from the farms on the Shoalhaven region, so on Wodiwodi country. I have actually seen them in great big vats, I've wondered where they were going. And which particular seaweeds are you going for? You describe where they come from but what species, do you know? We are working with green macroalgae, but we are sort of exploring a range of different species. So the incredible thing about seaweeds, not only can they be grown for food, they are highly nutritious, they can be used for fuel, they are nature's incredible form of carbon capture as well, so there's so many prospects and opportunities. Yes, we can work with seaweed to hopefully transform some of our material systems. Well, fortunately you are in a part of the university that has building people in it. When you show this to architects and other people who not only want stuff that's available and fast, they also want it cheap, and something that's not going to frighten the customers. It's really difficult work, and the building and the construction industry, from what I am learning, are incredibly slow to take up and take on new materials, and there's a whole range of factors because of that. I think what's really important though and what's really powerful and where I see my kind of role is being able to demonstrate alternatives, so that's what these objects are, they function as bricks, they look like bricks, they are heavy like bricks because they can then demonstrate what those potential material alternatives might be through further research, through further development, how we could move from those fossil-derived towards more bio-based and sustainable solutions. Something I mention quite often is Josh Byrne's house, Josh Byrne of course on a gardening program on Fridays hosted by Costa Georgiadis, and the point about what Josh Byrne is doing, he has online Josh's House with various experimental things which you can actually see and which you can cost. In other words, you can find out what the investment happens to be. And he's just been appointed the person in charge of sustainability, the section of the university over in Curtin in Perth, so there's a nice combination there, so it would be useful to be in touch. But when you show your colleagues here in the real building world, what do they say? They're really excited about it. I think the changes that we need to make, there's a big piece there around the intensity in which we use materials as well, so it's not just about replacing and finding sustainable alternatives. I think what we need to also address is the amount and the volume in which we use and the disposable and throwaway culture that we often attach to material objects and material products. So, being so close and situated to people in the built environment, to the School of Architecture and then also to science kind of enables what is a really complex problem to have a whole lot of different disciplinary expertise and mindsets coming at it at once, and that I think is the only way that we can drive change in this space. Yes, well, in this country of course mudbrick houses took off and people love them, and they are a status symbol. And with the example of Josh Byrne's house and other houses you can have to demonstrate to the public what is real and could be done, I don't imagine that even with things like transport, because concrete involves a huge amount of transportation. I think there is also something in there that's really important to try and think through, is the providence of the raw materials that you're using and then asking questions around those bigger systems of flow, those bigger production chains and supply chains, and I think there's something there, whereas if we can localise production as well, we can also work towards much lower carbon emitting material systems as well. I think there's incredible examples in Denmark in the archipelagos there where they've built roofs on houses out of eelgrass. Now, eelgrass isn't technically a seaweed, my scientist friends would correct me there if I said that it was, but the eelgrass is sourced along the intertidal zone on the islands and then it's compacted and used to build the roofs of these houses, and they are the most spectacular things, and some of them are 300 or 400 years old. They are rot resistant, they are antimicrobial, they are fire retardant, so there are these really incredible histories as well of these materials already being used in construction. It's very exciting, and be very careful when you're touching seagrasses of course because they absorb more carbon dioxide than almost any other plant on Earth, I think it's 10, 20, 30, 40 times more than tropical rainforests. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you very much.

"So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered the story of a man who was hospitalised with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps, increased thirst, and he had also lost close to 13 kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and it was vitamin D overdose, was it? Yes, vitamin D supplements, he had been taking way too many of them. And I don't know if it's just me but it feels like everywhere that I look I'm seeing other people ODing on vitamin. There was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D, there were women who have accidentally taken so much vitamin B6 that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at ABC Melbourne. Yes, if a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Exactly. So we're going to take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr Ian Musgrave who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi Ian. Hello, how are you? Good. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell. Vitamin overdose is certainly a thing but it seems to come in waves. For example, a lot of the vitamin D overdosing is occurring because people have thought that it might be a good way to prevent Covid. Sadly, tragically it's virtually useless as a preventative for Covid. One of the problems with the B6 is that, as your colleague has said, we all know that vitamins are important for us, we all know that we need vitamins for health, but we think that because a little bit is good for us, a lot maybe is better. And sadly, tragically with vitamins, this isn't true. And also what people don't realise is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what has happened with one person, for example, is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained B6, and it all added up so they ended up with B6 toxicity. It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realising. Yes, indeed. Unless you pay very close attention to what you're taking, you may not understand that there is enough vitamin B in everything you are taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects, especially the water-soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as having potentially toxic effects. But, for example, B6 is one where it's relatively easy to get up to a dose which can cause nerve damage. So we don't necessarily see it as being toxic per se, but if you were taking more than 300, 500 milligrams of B6 over time, it can cause nerve damage. It's something that's not really widely known because until the advent of high potency vitamin supplements, the chances of getting a B6 overdose were marginal. Yes, you weren't going to see it just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? If it's possible to get these sorts of effects, do people need to be better informed by…presumably a lot of the time you are buying them from a pharmacist or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a naturopath or something like that. Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well, they are regulated like medicines in Australia, but having said that I would like to point out that within Australia medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and they are regulated on two levels. You have low risk medicines, like vitamins, which are regulated by the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods where you don't need to require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it because they are assuming that you will read the instructions on the box and take them accordingly. And the registered medicines, which are things like, for example, paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence of them working but also strong evidence about their safety. The upshot is read those labels. Yes, and if it doesn't have an AUSTL or AUSSTAR number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much Dr Ian Musgrave for joining us. Thank you.

"Food labelling and the amount of added sugar in foods is a hot topic at the moment. Food Standards Australian and New Zealand are currently looking at ways to help people choose lower sugar foods. But a study released on Friday has had a counterintuitive finding, that putting warning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them. Well, to talk us through the findings and what they could mean is one of its authors, Miranda Blake. Welcome Miranda. Thank you for having me, Tegan. So you did an online survey asking people whether they'd buy things like breakfast cereal, yoghurt and non-alcoholic drinks while testing out different styles of sugar warning labels. Were you surprised by the results? Yes, we were, we expected to find that these would affect the likelihood of selecting a high sugar product, and we didn't find that. But systematic reviews with consumers have found that clearer labelling of added sugar on packaged foods does help consumers to pick lower sugar options. So I would say more research is needed. But we also did find that consumers strongly supported clear labelling of added sugar on packaging, so this suggests that if these labels were introduced there would be strong consumer support for that policy. Right, so people weren't…like, they were keen on them but what you're finding didn't really fit with previous findings. What could the disconnect be there? There is always the probability of just random chance in research. I think also we found that consumers are strongly supportive of having that information so that they could make an informed decision. So while we…again, the research does suggest that providing this information could help consumers to make healthier choices, I think the bottom line is also that consumers deserve to have the information to make that informed decision for themselves. Right, because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in a product. That's correct. So in Australia, manufacturers of packaged foods often add sugar to products, like breakfast cereals, yoghurts and drinks, but there is currently no way for Australians to know how much added sugar is in a packaged food, so that's why we tested these seven different labelling options to see if any of them had an impact on the likelihood of selecting a high sugar option. Right, so that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered, despite the overarching outcome of your study. Are there other reasons as well? Yes, so we know that in order to have any other policies around added sugar, so, for example, if we did education campaigns around added sugar or we restricted the marketing of products high in added sugar, we need to know how much added sugar is in products. So it's both important for providing information directly to consumers but also to support other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or, more broadly, to support consumers to select products that are lower in added sugar. Is this going to be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that warning labels should be on packaging? I hope not because I hope that they can see that, again, we had 85% of consumers who agreed that we need to set higher standards for how the food industry labels the foods we eat. And again, the broader evidence does suggest that this probably does help consumers to select healthier options. So, if we do introduce added sugar labelling policies, which the government is currently considering, that policy would need to be paired with an education campaign for consumers, particularly those with lower levels of literacy and numeracy, support them in how to use that information so that they can pick those products that are lower in added sugar. So how does this fit against other things that are on the table, for example, with sugar tax, and whether the new government might be heading in that direction or not? Well, it would be great to see if the Labor government would commit to an added sugar tax, either in food or drinks, preferably both, but I think what we can see is that, again, we need to be able to know how much added sugar is in food before we can introduce any policies. This is a really important step in supporting broader policies to support consumers to eat products that are lower in added sugar that are better for their well-being. How do these sorts of interventions interact with each other if you've got more than one thing happening at once? You've just measured one thing in this study but that's not really how it's going to work in the real world, just briefly. That's right, so we know from the example of tobacco regulation, for example, we saw…you know, over many years more and more policies were put into place, and these can work together, so they can be greater than the sum of their parts. So, added sugar labelling on its own may be made much more effective, for example, by having education campaigns around sugar content and a tax around added sugar as well, so they can work together to support healthy consumer choices. It's one that we are watching closely. Miranda, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks very much for having me.

"We have several unlikely but true revelations for you in The Science Show today. Houses made of seaweed. Intrepid voyages to and from Queensland, 2,000 years before the pyramids were built. And why Australia needs more varieties of dung beetles, and it isn't to clean up debris from some of our politicians. We also have a distinguished professor who loves nothing better than spending days working in a deep hole in the ground. Hello, I'm Robyn Williams, and we start this adventure in the Queensland Museum in Brisbane where Sophie Price is about to help open the Coral Connections exhibition. The question is, how did people first come here, apart from starting at the top end? And the answers come from some stunning new archaeology. My name is Sophie Price, I'm the Assistant Curator of Anthropology at Queensland Museum Network. But you're normally in Townsville, are you? I am, yes, so I work at the Museum of Tropical Queensland in Townsville but that's within the Queensland Museum Network, so we are spread across the four campuses across the state. And I imagine crossing the Coral Sea they would have come to the area which is now called Townsville rather more quickly than Brisbane. Absolutely, it was really important that we had this exhibition first up at the Museum of Tropical Queensland last year as the first instance of the exhibition, and then it has come down here to share the story with south-east Queensland. I must say that I've always thought of people first coming to Australia from the kind of Macassan region, Indonesian archipelago and so on from the straight north. But coming from the east, how long has that been well-known? Well, it's a really interesting story and I think we are only starting to really delve into the depth of that. So this exhibition that CABAH is doing and that the museum is assisting with in the exhibition, it's all based with the traditional owners on Jiigurru, on the Lizard Island and up in that Dingaal country, and it's telling a different sort of story, so instead of talking purely about human expansion, you know, straight to Australia, we are looking at human expansion down the coast of Queensland and how long ago that was happening and what was happening at the same time. But how long did it take? A long time, I think. You'll see in the exhibition there's some canoes and it would have taken a long time to traverse the sea. Let's go in. And I can see four canoes now. They're quite large actually. And before you had horses, of course water was the main real fast…that humans could travel and explore. Yes, absolutely, and it was really important for us to showcase the size and the extent of these canoes, of these seafaring vessels, so the first section of the exhibition you are really introduced to that concept of seafaring and how people moved and how they were transferring ideas and objects across the water. Some people suggested that not just the canoes but some of the sailing boats, and you've got one here in front of me, it looks very swish, one of the greatest inventions in human history. I would second that, absolutely. You look at the size of them and the significance of them and they are just amazing objects, so, definitely incredible. Okay, there's a long set of three canoes here. One of them is about four, five metres long. Yes, longer, it's almost up to six metres I believe. So we've got them stacked up on the wall and that's just showing the size of these ones, and then over the other side of the exhibition we actually have a fully formed outrigger canoe from Yarrabah, we call it bunul in the language from Yarrabah, and it is the only canoe that we have in the collection here that still has its outrigger attached, so it's really, really important. They look as if they are carved from one tree. They are, yes, and it's amazing when you think of the size of what the tree would have looked like and then transferring that into an object. So you've got to know what you want to achieve, it's a bit like making a statue with a lump of rock. Definitely, I would say it's even more crafty. Where do these three come from? These ones are actually drift canoes, so they would have come down from PNG and then they've washed up onto land up in the Cape region and then they've been collected. And they've been in a museum ever since? They have been, yes, so I think these ones were all early 1900s, one of them was collected around the 1930s, 1940s. Yes, very old. Does anyone know at this distance in time whether the explorers knew where they were going? That's an interesting question. Without the context of these particular objects, we can't be sure. With some of the other objects and obviously with oral histories from our traditional owners, they know where they were going and they know what their ancestors were doing. Some of the clues of course…we once did a Science Show series on the invention of navigation, but from the ark of course the whole point of sending up the dove, the dove would go into the sky and spot dry land and go off in that direction. So if you watched the animals, and indeed the coconuts floating, you could get clues. Yes, absolutely, and just on that point we do have…when you walk into the exhibition we've got this beautiful constellation that you walk underneath, and that's Tagai and that's a Torres Strait Islander constellation and it's one of the key ones that people were using up in the Straits to navigate across those waters, so it's very similar. Further around, before I talk to one of your colleagues, wonderful carving, it looks as if it has a great big rudder, it's very beautiful… Yes, we've got canoe prows and washboards, so these are, again, are telling that seafaring story and just showing intricacy of the detail as well of all of these crafts. And further along here, we talk about the generations who are involved, there's a wonderful picture of the sea people, mostly men. Did women travel much, do you know? As far as I know women didn't travel on these canoes, definitely not up in the Straits or Cape York that I'm aware of. However, that might be knowledge that's not shared with us in the museum, and yes, we will have to look into that further. Are you an anthropologist? Yes, so I work in anthropology, so particularly First Nations and social history. Before I let you go, just one quick glance over here, which looks like some of the material that came out of the boats, from beads, tools… Yes, all sorts of things, so this area of the exhibition is talking about that cultural exchange, so it's looking at in particular all of the items that were shared across the Coral Sea, so between the cultural groups of New Guinea, Torres Strait, and North Queensland, and it also goes into items that weren't shared, so it's looking at the agency and the decision-making of all these cultural groups, what they wanted to share and what they didn't. Thank you very much, very exciting. Thank you so much, I hope you enjoy. Sophie Price, and her message clearly is these connections were not a one-way passage, this was a lively to-ing and fro-ing like any sophisticated interaction between communities across the Coral Sea over 6,000 years ago. And so to the distinguished Professor of Indigenous Archaeology from Monash, down the hole, Ian McNiven. At the exhibition there's a wonderful sequence of you down the hole, which is a deep hole going down thousands of years, and it looks as if it's a wall until you look closer and you can see the stones and also thousands of large shells showing that's where people ate all those years ago. What were you measuring down that hole? History, in a word, but thousands of years of Aboriginal history, and that's why we do it and that's why we've spent a lot of time…I mean, I spent days down that hole, but it's because we know it's all going somewhere and it's this wonderful understanding that you have that Aboriginal people have been in places literally for thousands of years, and there it is right in front of your eyes, you're just seeing thousands of meals layered up in front of you. So it's a wonderful experience, it's a wonderful privilege to be able to do this sort of work and, boy, if I can get paid to stand in a hole for weeks… Making notes, yes, but the wonderful point that you make is that people might have said that's a midden, in other words that's a rubbish dump, it is not, it's systematic, and you've also got Lapita pottery. They didn't think that there was pottery around in that area, and what you describe of that sort of discovery was it's amazing stuff, it's really ground-breaking stuff, literally. Well, you never know what you're going to find when you do archaeology and that's why we do it because it's always full of surprises. And what I like about what we've done working on Lizard Island is that we knew there were lots of places there where Aboriginal people have been, it's their home. It might be a shell midden, and that's what archaeologists call it, but at the end of the day this is somebody's home and it's been home for hundreds of generations of people, so we always have that in mind. But yes, the pottery we've found…we're not too sure whether it actually is Lapita or might be just after Lapita. Either way, it's related somehow. That's a group of people, the Lapita people. Yes, the Lapita people who are the famous people who first went out into the Pacific to settle the remote Oceania. We only ever thought that they went out, basically headed east, but now we know that there was another arm of Lapita that came along the south coast of Papua New Guinea and possibly the last Lapita people or the next few generations then moved further west, came into Torres Strait, and those influences came down the Queensland coast with Aboriginal people. So there's something going on between 2,000 to 3,000 years ago where everybody is connected over thousands of kilometres on these what we call canoe highways where ideas and objects are being shared, and we've seen that right here in this exhibition. There are a couple of surprises about what you've done here, and one of them is we imagine of course human beings out of Africa, it's as if they knew where they were going over thousands of years, down to Australia, 65,000 years ago. But what you show with the excavations is that people were coming and going, they didn't just come down south, they went north as well. Well, I started going to Torres Strait 25 years ago but we had no idea that we were going to find pottery there as well, so that was all new because historically there is no pottery in Torres Strait, but there we found it, between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago. And of course, as most people know, Aboriginal people did not traditionally make pottery. So when we were doing the work on Lizard Island, we were shocked, literally shocked to find this pottery buried deeply in this shell midden. And it talks to the history of Aboriginal people that, as you say, it's not isolation. Aboriginal people have been interacting with people overseas, we know that with the Macassans over perhaps 1,000 years, we're not too sure, but also there's another connection that goes up through Torres Strait into Papua New Guinea. So Aboriginal people have had international relationships, trading relationships, social relationships, family relationships going back for thousands of years that extend beyond our shores, and I find that a fantastic story. How come you were working so far north when in fact you are based in Melbourne? It's cold. I'm originally from Queensland, I'm very committed to the history and the Indigenous history and cultures of Queensland, so I love working up here. And what would your message be to the public now that this exhibition is open, telling this amazing story, why should they come along to the Queensland Museum? Because it will change the way that you view the history of Queensland, it will change the way that you view the Indigenous people of Queensland. There are things here that you will see that we literally did not know existed up until a couple of years ago. So, if you want a new experience, a new understanding of the state that you live in, come along to this exhibition. Thanks Ian. Thank you, Robyn. Ian McNiven is Professor of Indigenous Archaeology at Monash. And a final word from Sean Ulm, deputy director of the Centre of Excellence of Biodiversity and Heritage. He's usually based in Cairns, northern Queensland. We are standing next to the representation of the hole in the ground where Ian was. What do you think of that? One of the best things you've done, you were saying? This excavation has been extraordinary on Jiigurru or the Lizard Island group, working in partnership with the traditional owners. There are very few middens anywhere in Australia, and particularly on the east coast of Australia, that are as deep as this one. So the lowest cultural material at this excavation was at nearly two metres, and those shells at two metres down were reef shells from the edge of the reef crest at the edge of the lagoon and they still had the colour on them, and they are radiocarbon dated at 6,500 years ago, and they were buried so rapidly that the sun didn't have time to bleach the colour of them. It's an incredibly rare thing in my career, working around the world on coastal sites, to see such extraordinary preservation. But the real humdinger of this was the pottery that we found. Between 60 and 80 centimetres below the surface we found dozens of sherds of pottery dating between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago which we believe to be the oldest pottery in Australia. Quite extraordinary, isn't it, and what I love about this exhibition, apart from the fact that we've got a simulacrum of being down the hole, being down the dig, is you've got a screen there where visitors can point to a sort of lump and it explains what it is and shows you the creature that might have been and how deep it is and how old it is. Well done. Absolutely. One of our real priorities here was to get this into the public realm. So, very few people have the opportunity to visit an archaeological site or a cultural place and participate in an archaeological excavation. So, right from the beginning of the project we were thinking of ways we could develop outreach products. So, a 3D, full-scale print of the pit, so that people could actually touch and feel and stand inside the pit was one part of it, but the interactive screen was really important, particularly for school outreach. And you might have noticed, Robyn, that we've got Indigenous language names in that interactive display and throughout the exhibition, which is really honouring that Indigenous centred approach to the entire partnership that gave rise to this project. Well Sean, you are about to open with the distinguished parties, including the director of the museum, so congratulations and thank you. Thanks again, Robyn. That was Distinguished Professor Sean Ulm, James Cook University, based in Cairns. He is also deputy director of the Centre of Excellence for Biodiversity and Heritage, which also mounted the exhibition that has just opened at the Queensland Museum in Brisbane. The Science Show on RN. And so to a new book called Tunnels in Time , a bit like that midden, except these are through caves and rocks, telling the story of our marsupials. It's written by Lyndall Dawson who now lives on the south coast of New South Wales. Tell me about the Wellington Caves, where are they and why do you think they are important? Wellington Caves are in western New South Wales, they have some tourist caves, nice, interesting tourist caves but they are not Jenolan, they're not anything pretty. They are interesting from a historical point of view, but most importantly they are interesting because they were the first place in Australia that our extinct marsupial species were discovered way back in 1830. Way back in 1830. Was someone looking for them or did they happen to be digging for something else? Actually in a way they were looking for them. At this stage in England the subject of extinct animals was alive and well because the Enlightenment had brought out the fact that maybe everything wasn't biblical, but fossils in England were being discovered and being ascribed to the biblical flood that had wiped them out. And so Australia, even in those days, because it had been settled 50 years before that, was a test case. We knew the fauna was really different here, and if Noah's flood had wiped out the lions and elephants and things that should have lived in Australia, that would prove the point. So people already were interested enough in Australian fauna to be testing that idea. And a chap who evidently was called a gentleman from Bathurst, Rankin, did some exploring around the Wellington area, west of Bathurst and…well, he was climbing into a hole in the ground in the limestone hill and he fell and grabbed a branch or a root or something that snapped off and it turned out to be a giant bone. And he was astute enough to contact the surveyor general, Sir Thomas Mitchell, tell him about it, who was astute enough and knowledgeable enough to know that this was a really important find. So that started it all. The Mitchell? The Mitchell, the Thomas Mitchell, yes. And what did the bone turn out to be? Well, it turned out to be very controversial, it was just a limb bone, but immediately Thomas Mitchell rode across the mountains on his horse to Wellington, that's how important they thought it was, and sampled bones out of that cave, sent them back to England where one of the bones was described by the most important anatomist at the time, Jameson I think, as the tusk of an elephant, which really fired up enthusiasm. I could imagine, it would prove the Bible was true. Exactly, that's right, but Thomas Mitchell himself was educated enough to be very sceptical about that elephant idea. And the other person who came into the story eventually was Sir Richard Owen who… That man. That man, and that man was I think probably one of the greatest geniuses on the planet because he could put these tiny little fragments of bits and pieces of broken bone together and turn them into animals and identify them, and he was always right. And sitting in the main hall of the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, but he wasn't right about evolution because he didn't actually like Darwin's ideas, did he. No, that's right. But he also named dinosaurs. However, that's Richard Owen. Meanwhile in Wellington of course, in the area and other parts of Australia, as you put in your book, the most amazing amount of digging and clearing of ground was going on. Did they actually take care to see whether there were any more bones, or was it just holocaust? Some people were actively looking for bones in those days, particularly up on the Darling Downs had just been settled and people who had just taken up pieces of land there would find big bones sticking out of the creek beds, and so they were interested enough to send them back to the museum and they sent them over to England in vast quantities from Victoria, from Queensland, many, many more from Wellington Caves, and it became a really important subject. It's interesting, isn't it, because your book is in three parts, and what we are talking about is the first part obviously which is the way in which the first explorations were being made just over 150 years ago, and painting a picture of what was a clearly different landscape with different fauna. And did it sink in fairly quickly, that Australia is completely different? Yes, actually, I think under Richard Owen who really took this subject under his wing and got…the Australian Museum opened up a few years after that, about 20 years later, you know… 1827. Richard Owen promoted exploration, found money for it. He by then was quite convinced that these were all marsupials, they were all related to the living fauna and that Australia was unique and different. And they were finding the most extraordinary animals. Diprotodon we know about, which is a hippo-sized wombat, if you like, but what about Thylacoleo? And this is a marsupial lion. What did it look like? It probably looked somewhat lion-like, yes, he had a nice round head with lots of muscles and things and a big jaw, about the same size as a female lion. It certainly was a very interesting controversial journey because, once again, Richard Owen twigged fairly quickly that this was a carnivore, although it had the most unusual dentition, different teeth from anything else and any other carnivore. It wasn't a little bit like Tasmanian Tigers, it had very unique teeth. And that sparked a huge controversy in England because the other anatomists said no, things with teeth like that have to be vegetarian because they have the same sort of teeth as the other…we called them diprotodons, the ones with two bottom teeth and two upper teeth that nibble grass and ate fruit and things like that. Thylacoleo had those sort of incisor teeth, nothing like a carnivore. But Owen stuck to his guns, Owen said it was a carnivore. But even in the 1920s, people were still arguing with that idea and saying it couldn't have been a carnivore. But studies have been done that have absolutely nailed it. And that's nearly 200 years later, it was still controversial. Quite interesting that in a cave in the Nullarbor, John Long and friends found Thylacoleo down in another huge cave, and I think it was several of them but this really was a terribly exciting find. Nullarbor Caves have just been the most exciting new find in the last 20 or 30 years in Australia, instead of all these fragmentary bits of bones that have been broken up, and they found whole skeletons and that's where…they've been putting this jigsaw of Thylacoleo together for 150 years but it didn't ever have a tail, they hadn't found its tail, and sure as eggs, yes, in the Nullarbor Cave they found Thylacoleo's tail, whacko, so they could put the whole animal together. Lyndall, what's your interest in this? Are you an archaeologist, are you a mammalogist or what? I was trained as a zoologist. I was lucky enough to meet up with people like Mike Archer when I was looking for a postgraduate topic, and there was a whole collection of stuff in the Australian Museum that hadn't been touched for 150 years that needed to be looked at, so that became the subject of my PhD. Once again, completely self-taught. And you're quite interested in, of course, the ever-controversial question about how some of these big animals…because you mentioned the Australian Museum, of course they had and still have in exhibition mode a few of these giant animals, huge kangaroo or one of the species of kangaroo you point out because there are many, many different species of kangaroo, and the big animals, the megafauna diminished in number. And in your book you review what might be one of the causes. How do you come up with a conclusion so far? Well, I'm trying carefully to step between the various parties that are interested in this subject, and this is where I first got most interested while I was doing this work at the museum. It became clear to me that people were completely divided in theories about how these things became extinct. One camp was saying that when humans first arrived in Australia, suddenly the megafauna just couldn't cope and were all hunted to extinction. Another camp in those days said that no, it went more along the lines that it did in North America where the ice age was approaching and the climate was changing, so that became extinct. Well, I knew neither of those tales really rang true, there must be something in between. And it's taken 40 years of work, and it's only in the last 20 years that…not my work but enough other work has been done because of improved technology in order to actually bring enough data to sort this controversy out. It's been a very active debate for a long time. A combination of the two; climate and people? Well, that's my theory, yes, because now that we have very good data on about 300,000 years of climate, leading up to a series of ice ages, I call it the rollercoaster of climate, we call it a glacial maximum not an ice age because in Australia it wasn't like Europe or North America where we had ice covering the land, but we did have extremely harsh, dry, cold periods. And the biggest of the megafauna survived up to about 300,000 years ago, this evidence comes from Nullarbor and Naracoorte Caves, that they were all doing very well, but the last two major ice ages after that started to have an impact on the fauna I think, and the evidence is everything was changing in Australia. We were heading into what we are now, an arid country. But one of the things that is pointed out to some extent by you and to some extent by other experts, when you're looking at the fossils of megafauna that have been killed, either by the weather or by people, what you might look for are any kind of cut marks as if they have been hit by clubs or I don't know what, that indicate that there had been violence in the killing rather than just slow demise. There was a story that was very popular in North America way back in the 1960s and 1970s. What I've decided is that Australia and North America had very similar problems with very, very different outcomes for the fauna, but in North America, particularly in Arizona and places like that, they did find deposits of extinct giant sloths and bears with tooth marks and spear points and things like that in them. But it transpires that most of the North American megafauna survived perhaps 30,000 years longer than the Australian megafauna. So the Australian megafauna disappeared perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, and there is no evidence of direct arrowheads or spear points or those sort of things in any of the fossils, except at Cuddie Springs in northern New South Wales there seems to be evidence of dried blood on stone implements, which is surprising after all that time. It could have been possums. It could have been possums, yes. But it doesn't necessarily take a spear to turn something extinct. Look at our koalas and things these days that we are worrying about extinction, but nobody is killing them off, they are just suffering from habitat destruction. So, similar things might have been happening then. It's a lovely book, congratulations. Thank you very much. Lyndall Dawson's book is called Tunnels in Time , and she lives on the south coast of New South Wales. A link on the Science Show website. You're on RN. A few months ago I was struck, as were hundreds of visitors to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, by an exhibition of artistic works based on recovered materials, and little did I know then that lots of the work was inspired by research at the University of Technology in Sydney on using similar unusual sources to make buildings and refashion them. And so I met Professor Tim Schork. Where are we? You said this is where the magic happens. What kind of magic? All sorts of magic. As you can see, we have facilities like a large robot and also smaller robots, we have CNC equipment, and the magic that happens here is that we experimentally explore new building processes but also new materials, and we both built the hardware and software where we bring together interdisciplinary knowledge from different fields and work actively with industry partners on projects. And on the bench here you have a gigantic roll of what looks like some sort of plastic wrapper. What is it? Yes, it is indeed plastic, it's one of the prototypes, if you can look at it, all those little wrinkles are actually pores within that long extrusion and it's printed out of recycled plastic, in particular wrapping or for medical devices, I think it's quite a common material there. But we don't actually in Australia look into the circular economy and life-cycle of this material, so this is one of the aspects the project did, to look into industrial waste streams and how can we use those in the built environment. And how it's made, is it 3D printed with a robot and it's actually an extrusion, so the robot prints layer by layer and then accelerates in order to introduce the pores which is key to the project because we all know air-conditioning, it's something that we feel actually quite uncomfortable with, we get all this air dumped on us, it's not a really pleasant environment. The project really looked at how can we redesign a system for existing office buildings. It's also quite important to note that a lot of building works actually happens actually happens in the refurbishment buildings, we don't really build so many new buildings in Australia, so adaptive reuse. And how we can think about bringing air much better actually into the space, you know, something that is diffuse rather than these really cold dumps of air that make us all uncomfortable. Now, you've also got lots of chunks of very nice wood, it looks almost like cake, it's beautifully made and put together with different layers, different colours. Yes, we work across a series of different building materials, we certainly work with timber as well, we are fortunate enough to have recently been funded by the Australian Research Council on a project that is led by the University of Queensland, a research hub around how to uptake timber in Australia. But we also certainly work on how to reduce the embodied carbon also when it comes to concrete. We now have expertise and techniques that we can reduce how much concrete we use. We certainly will need to continue building with concrete. Not everything can be made out of timber or biomaterials. But we are working on this with colleagues in engineering as well, in order to try to use less but use it smartly. I mean, the greatest invention is still opening a window, but that's not always possible. No, I know, they lock them all! Well, they lock them all for all sorts of reasons. I mean, one of the reasons as well is not just around safety but actually people sometimes just open the window at the wrong time and therefore their entire HVAC system needs to work even harder rather than maintaining temperature. Certainly as a German we know what cross ventilation is, but there is a lot of work saying…you know, you mentioned before timber and other things where we can actually look into new ways to design, we can also look at biological systems and other fields of knowledge that can assist us how we can just basically designed and also feel smarter. Have you had anything to do with the green building just across the road from the university here? Not in the design, I certainly go there sometimes. But we had something to do with that, together with a colleague, Sara Wilkinson, and another company, where we developed, thanks to the City of Sydney, to look at a façade inspection, where we were able to actually help in maintaining the green building façade, which is a very important thing for biodiversity and microclimate within a city, but the very big challenge around it is actually how to maintain this. So we worked on a project like that with colleagues in engineering, our robotics group over there, so we had a very, very close look at that. Have they been able to solve many of the problems that have arisen? I'm not too sure if they solved all of the problems, but it certainly has been a very tough couple of years also around climate around this as well and the kind of replacement of those planter boxes, and this is why we do this research, we know that we have a global climate crisis that we need to address this and we need to do this at all ends. And my final question, we both know somebody called Robbie who lives in Balmain and I was introduced to her because she was looking after a project connected with the Royal Botanic Gardens where people were making displays and art out of recycled material. That was part of an exhibition earlier this year. That's how we met. Thanks to Robbie and a big shout-out to her, a really lovely person. It was a great exhibition, Transformation, at the Friends of the Botanic Gardens over there, you can actually see those 3D printed coloured objects which were done by students. I mentioned before that we certainly do a lot of research here but this space is also used by students because our main aim is to educate the next generation of designers, of architects. Yes, it was fantastic and a really wonderful exhibition and they are certainly doing some great work there. So there we have engineers, botanists, architects, artists, all working together in various ways, as Tim Schork, Associate Professor in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney described. And of course, all green buildings require adjustment as they grow and experiment. Close to his lab full of robots and 3D plastics redeployed, giving a smoother air conditioning, is another lab, containing Kate Scardifield. We are sitting in the Material Ecologies Design Lab in the Faculty of Design, Architecture and Building at UTS. And there are all sorts of things on your very long table, and they look vaguely organic, and I know of course the source of many of them, but one of them looks almost like a sort of nut log that you could chomp. What is it? Some of them do look a little bit edible. I wouldn't bite into them. We've got a whole range of different materials in development in this space, so the Materials Ecologies Design Lab, or MEDL as it's very affectionately known, is a kind of lab-come-studio-come-kitchen space for materials experimentation and design, and it hosts a range of different research products that intersect with science and engineering and architecture. And I guess the underlying thematic for the group of researchers working in here is to think about what a shift away from fossil derived materials towards bio-based regenerative and reparative materials might look like. Well, of course your university I know well because I saw it being built, mainly of concrete, which is famously…you know, CO 2 everywhere. Absolutely. I mean, the building industry remains one of the most polluting industries globally, it's responsible for a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions, it's incredibly energy intensive the way that we build, with steel, with glass. So, some of the material investigations and the research that's happening in this space are trying to think through materials for application in building and construction, that's what I've been focused on most recently. And famously including seaweed. Yes, I have been working with seaweed now for nearly two years. I'm working really closely with a group of marine scientists and biochemists and we've been looking at ways in which we can use seaweed derived products to create more sustainable material solutions for the future. Well, of course the first instinct is that there is lots of seaweed that might be, like kelp, quite robust, but it's still sloshy. How do you make it firm and buildable? So, seaweed and the macroalgae that we've been using is seaweed that has been grown for water remediation, so it is already actually attached to existing aquaculture systems where it's cleaning and filtering water, and because seaweed thrives on sunlight and nitrogen and it grows really exponentially and fast, it produces a huge amount of biomass. And so the work that I've been doing is looking at ways in which we might utilise that biomass as a carbon sink and then think about transforming that into materials that we could stick into buildings and hopefully take out of circulation for a while. And so these rather large nutty, brownish, elegant…you're actually going for one of the ones which isn't formed, it's just like a great big lump of stone really. It does look like stone, doesn't it. The first time I saw it, it reminded me of a kind of volcanic rock. And so this is how it dries naturally, if you harvest it, press it and then just let it sun-dry, it dries incredibly hard and quite gnarly and rocklike, like this. So what I've been trying to do is look at different systems for controlling the drying process and then combining that with different binders and different fillers in order to produce these kind of brick-like forms that hopefully are on their way to some mechanical testing processes. Yes, the one you're actually touching there is at least half a metre and got some elegant almost sculpture-like holes through it, and it's solid as, well, a rock, and is that seaweed as well? It is, it's a combination of seaweed biomass and oyster shell waste. So I've been working with Appellation Oysters who are a really fantastic co-op that represent a number of the New South Wales oyster farms, and looking at sourcing some of their shell waste when it arrives, and then integrating that into this mix with the algae. Oyster shells are full of calcium carbonate and they are incredibly strong, so part of this project was looking at ways in which we could create a composite with those two materials. I really like the kind of relationship they also have, they are part of a marine ecology, they speak to maritime histories but they are also both filtration devices, they're bivalves. Did you say appellation? Appellation Oysters. You don't get them from Appalachia? No, I don't, most of the shells that are pressed into these bricks have come from the farms on the Shoalhaven region, so on Wodiwodi country. I have actually seen them in great big vats, I've wondered where they were going. And which particular seaweeds are you going for? You describe where they come from but what species, do you know? We are working with green macroalgae, but we are sort of exploring a range of different species. So the incredible thing about seaweeds, not only can they be grown for food, they are highly nutritious, they can be used for fuel, they are nature's incredible form of carbon capture as well, so there's so many prospects and opportunities. Yes, we can work with seaweed to hopefully transform some of our material systems. Well, fortunately you are in a part of the university that has building people in it. When you show this to architects and other people who not only want stuff that's available and fast, they also want it cheap, and something that's not going to frighten the customers. It's really difficult work, and the building and the construction industry, from what I am learning, are incredibly slow to take up and take on new materials, and there's a whole range of factors because of that. I think what's really important though and what's really powerful and where I see my kind of role is being able to demonstrate alternatives, so that's what these objects are, they function as bricks, they look like bricks, they are heavy like bricks because they can then demonstrate what those potential material alternatives might be through further research, through further development, how we could move from those fossil-derived towards more bio-based and sustainable solutions. Something I mention quite often is Josh Byrne's house, Josh Byrne of course on a gardening program on Fridays hosted by Costa Georgiadis, and the point about what Josh Byrne is doing, he has online Josh's House with various experimental things which you can actually see and which you can cost. In other words, you can find out what the investment happens to be. And he's just been appointed the person in charge of sustainability, the section of the university over in Curtin in Perth, so there's a nice combination there, so it would be useful to be in touch. But when you show your colleagues here in the real building world, what do they say? They're really excited about it. I think the changes that we need to make, there's a big piece there around the intensity in which we use materials as well, so it's not just about replacing and finding sustainable alternatives. I think what we need to also address is the amount and the volume in which we use and the disposable and throwaway culture that we often attach to material objects and material products. So, being so close and situated to people in the built environment, to the School of Architecture and then also to science kind of enables what is a really complex problem to have a whole lot of different disciplinary expertise and mindsets coming at it at once, and that I think is the only way that we can drive change in this space. Yes, well, in this country of course mudbrick houses took off and people love them, and they are a status symbol. And with the example of Josh Byrne's house and other houses you can have to demonstrate to the public what is real and could be done, I don't imagine that even with things like transport, because concrete involves a huge amount of transportation. I think there is also something in there that's really important to try and think through, is the providence of the raw materials that you're using and then asking questions around those bigger systems of flow, those bigger production chains and supply chains, and I think there's something there, whereas if we can localise production as well, we can also work towards much lower carbon emitting material systems as well. I think there's incredible examples in Denmark in the archipelagos there where they've built roofs on houses out of eelgrass. Now, eelgrass isn't technically a seaweed, my scientist friends would correct me there if I said that it was, but the eelgrass is sourced along the intertidal zone on the islands and then it's compacted and used to build the roofs of these houses, and they are the most spectacular things, and some of them are 300 or 400 years old. They are rot resistant, they are antimicrobial, they are fire retardant, so there are these really incredible histories as well of these materials already being used in construction. It's very exciting, and be very careful when you're touching seagrasses of course because they absorb more carbon dioxide than almost any other plant on Earth, I think it's 10, 20, 30, 40 times more than tropical rainforests. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you very much.

Innovation crosses boundaries. And of course so do dung beetles. We have many, but we need more it seems. Here's an extract from one of my favourite ABC programs from a couple of weeks ago, Country Breakfast on RN. So we're looking for a cow pat with a little bit of dirt that has come up through it… At a farm on Far North Queensland's Atherton Tablelands, these people are behaving in a rather strange way. They are searching through piles of cattle dung and looking for a little animal that has one of the most unappealing and yet important jobs in the world; eating animal droppings. Dr Bernard Doube is the world's leading ecologist specialising in studying this small and misunderstood creature. This is a beetle that comes from the high rainfall districts of eastern Africa and we introduced it about 30 years ago and it's got a very restricted distribution up here on the Atherton and hardly anywhere else in Australia. But up here it's doing a great job. It digs a tunnel to about 20 centimetres, something like that, lines the tunnel with dung and so the earthworms that are here, they go down feeding on the dung that's lining the tunnel, and then down below the beetle puts perhaps half a litre of dung, something like that, a huge amount really, and lays a whole lot of eggs in it, the eggs hatch into larvae, the larvae then eat all of the dung, the adult beetles feed on the dung juices and the larvae feed on the dung fibre. And so then the larvae crap out this processed stuff, which is rather like compost. And so down at 20 centimetres you've now got earthworm casts and down below you've got a great big pile of plant nutrients ready, and so the roots grow down there, and so you get increased production and increased carbon storage because it's a relatively permanent change in the structure of the soil. So the dung beetles are of great benefit in terms of increasing the permeability of the soil to moisture. But up here the water goes straight in. So the primary benefits are to get the dung underground, stop pasture fouling, and also then to increase the subsoil fertility of the region, and so this will last us quite some years, and so over time the whole pasture will be processed by dung beetle activity, and our experiments from southern Australia indicate that we get about a 30% increase in productivity due to the dung burial activity of the beetles. Dr Bernard Doube on Country Breakfast , RN. And so to a newcomer. CSIRO in Canberra are importing a fresh visitor, and Dr Valerie Caron is in charge of this servant of Sisyphus. My first question is this; we've got about 500 native dung beetles in Australia, they've been here for squillions of years, why do we need to import more, as we did some time ago? You are right, we have amazing dung beetles that are native to Australia and we do have 500 species. The only issue with these amazing creatures is that they coevolved with native fauna, they have coevolved with them. So they are very much used to that kind of dung, kind of dry, fibrous dung produced by kangaroos and wombats and all that. So when Europeans brought those cows and sheep, they produce a lot of dung, those beetles could not deal with it, so they could not use that dung and it just accumulated on the soil surface and that has a lot of negative impact. So that's why we bring dung beetles from other countries, so we bring dung beetles that can deal with that cattle and sheep dung. And how many have been brought so far? So we are at 44 species now, so that's quite a lot of species but that's in over 60 years, it's a very long program. So during this program that we are doing now, we are bringing three new ones. From Morocco. Yes, they are coming from Morocco, for various reasons. So we are trying to really focus on southern Australia and spring dung beetles that we are looking for. So Morocco has an amazing diversity of dung beetles, they have a lot of cattle, they have a lot of herds, they have a very high population of dung beetles compared to other countries. I thought for one minute you were going to talk about how we need to have dung beetles for camel dung. We have camels too! Actually, camels are an invasive species in Australia and they produce a copious amount of dung, but we are not focusing on that at the moment. Morocco has a very diverse climate, which is very interesting because they do have mountains, they are bordered by sea, bordered by desert on the other side, so they have very varied climate, which is actually quite useful for us when we are looking for dung beetles that would thrive in Australia. And what sort of dung are they after when you let them loose? Cattle and sheep mostly. The area where we go in Morocco, it's where there are big herds of cows and mostly sheep and goats, and there is always a donkey. Yes, sure, always a donkey, but surely to cover that we've already got various imported dung beetles, even for South Australia, to look after that problem. What need is there for these new ones? So we do have 44 species that were introduced, 23 have established, so they are doing a great job. But each dung beetle has an activity window, they are not active all year round, and what we want is dung beetles that actually…when they're active and they take the dung down to the soil. So we don't want the dung to stay on the surface. So those species of beetles are great, but there are still some gaps. So we've got gaps in season and we have geographical gaps as well. What we are focusing on now is on the gap in spring that is all over southern Australia, so we are talking about WA all the way to Tasmania and New South Wales. So we are really covering a large area. So in early spring there are not enough dung beetles doing the job, and then the dung just accumulates on the soil surface and it causes a lot of different problems, it spoils pasture, accumulation of dung, if there is a flood it will go in the waterways and then can cause water pollution. And also one of the main things I think that all Australians care about is the bush flies that are very annoying, they actually spread and grow in dung. So if you have a lot of dung on a surface, you provide a lot of habitat for those flies to thrive and then you can get these crazy populations of flies. They are just very annoying, they don't bite but they are still really, really difficult to deal with. Yes, that was the main reason, way back in the beginning, that an awful lot of people…the corks on your brimmed hat weren't enough to keep them away and so people just got terribly fed up…and this brilliant idea. But tell me, when these dung beetles…we've all seen films of them, a bit like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the mountain forever, they of course are rolling, these dung beetles, this beautiful work of the round pieces of dung which they're pushing towards presumably their burrows. Yes, so it's interesting because we always think about the dung beetle that rolls the ball, in fact at the moment we only have two species that are established that are rollers, all the other ones are tunnellers. So what they do is they make little tunnels under the dung pad and then they will take the dung down, make a little ball, and that's where they actually lay their eggs, so they need to take out that dung to provide resources for their developing larvae. So the roller, we only have two species, we just imported a new one that actually is a roller as well, they are amazing and we see them even climbing walls of cages. They are actually really good at rolling that ball if they really want to go. You really love these creatures, don't you, and the dung, you're a coprologist. Well, let's say I'm working on the beetles than the actual dung, but they are really fascinating creatures, and what I find the most interesting is that each species has their own little quirks and their own behaviour and they are all quite different, and that, as a scientist, is the most fascinating thing. Have you done much, by the way…the problem that most people have in science who are importing new species is to make sure that they don't disturb the ecology when they turn up in surprising ways. Yes, that's actually one of the main things that we have to do and we are very, very careful with that, so it's very hard to introduce anything in Australia and we should be very proud of our biosecurity policies and all the people that keep our borders safe, actually. So when we introduced dung beetles it was a very long process for people to actually accept dung beetles to be imported, so we have a special permit for that. There was a big risk assessment that was done as well by the Department of Environment then. And also when we bring dung beetles in we bring adults, so they are collected from the field in Morocco, they are then cleaned, identified, starved, sent to a laboratory in France because we have CSIRO's laboratory in southern France. Then they are again fed maybe for a little while but they will be cleaned again. We have to remove any little organism that could be on them because little things hitchhike on dung beetles, little mites for example. And then they will be cleaned again, starved and then sent to Australia. They will only be kept in a quarantine facility, which is actually at Black Mountain. We receive the adults, we again clean them just to make sure they are fine, we feed them because they are very hungry by that stage, and that's where we breed them. But the only thing we can take out of quarantine are their eggs, and the eggs have been surface-sterilised, so there is absolutely nasty that can come out. So the eggs are squeaky-clean, no viruses, no nematodes, nothing that can be on them, then we take them out and then we can rear them, which is incredible that it's working really because it's a very harsh chemical we are using on them. Very reassuring. By the way, you mentioned mites, of course we are terribly worried about mites at the moment in regard to bees, aren't we. Yes, so a different type of mites, there is such a diversity of mites in the world. Dung is actually an ecosystem, there are so many things living in dung, which I find really impressive, but yes, there are little mites that will be in the dung, and what they do is that they actually hitchhike on the dung beetles. So when they want to move pad, instead of moving themselves, they are little, they can't fly, they will just hop on the dung beetle and then the dung beetle will take them somewhere else. So we make sure we don't bring those in the country, and even if they were coming to quarantine, they can't come out of quarantine anyway, so it's very, very safe. So, very different from the varroa mite, it's a very big problem on bees. Very reassuring, given the precautions that you mentioned. My final question to you, you come from Canada, from Québec, how is it that you are transferred to such an Australian measure? I can imagine it's a bit too snowy and icy in parts of Canada to have dung beetles, the poor things. But thank you so much, Valerie. Thank you so much.
