"G’day, Dr Karl here. Now last time, I talked about how over the last few years, the spin of the Earth has suddenly accelerated. This is totally against the long-term trend of the last one-and-a-half billion years, where the spin of the Earth has been gradually slowing down. In the combined Earth-Moon system, there are well-known interactions that will slow the spin of the Earth. But what can happen to our solitary spinning planet that can make it change speed? Well, if the Earth was a solid, smooth, rigid ball, then the answer is easy - nothing.  But, the earth is much more complicated. First, it has an atmosphere, which weighs about 5,000 trillion tons. Changes in the atmosphere can affect the spin of the Earth In an El Niño year, stronger winds can slow down the Earth’s spin, to make the days longer. And other weather patterns can also affect the spin. The Andes mountain chain in South America is incredibly narrow , very long , and surprisingly high .  Because they run virtually North-South while the winds usually blow either East or West, and because they are so long and so high, they are very effective at shifting energy from the wind into the spinning Earth. The Andes - they are like a giant sail in the wind. Depending on which way the winds are hitting the Andes, the Earth can speed up or slow down. We have measured changes in the length of the day of about 0.2 millisecond, caused just by the wind on the Andes. Second, let’s look at the surface of the earth. The Earth’s surface is a complex mess of oceans , glaciers , and continents . All this happens in the Earth’s crust, which is about 6-60 kilometres thick. Sometimes, a sizeable chunk of that crust can suddenly shift. In 2004, an earthquake in the Indian Ocean set off the terrible tsunami that killed about a quarter of a million people in 14 countries. But it also shifted enough rock to make the day shorter by 3 microseconds . The Fukushima earthquake of 2011 shortened the length of the day by 1.8 microseconds. But these were little blips in the overall trend. What we are seeing now are changes a thousand times bigger – milliseconds, not microseconds. And still looking at Earth’s surface, what about the 70% that is water? Surprisingly, the oceans are not dead flat. They can have dips , which can happen when a huge pool of warm water accumulates in one area. Or the oceans can have bulges . We’ve seen this change happen in ocean currents with El Niño. Of course, given enough time, these dips and bulges will eventually smooth out. But in the short-term of days to months, these dips and bulges can sit there, and so the mass of water is not evenly distributed. So it’s like our skater spinning on one leg - shifting mass closer to, or further from, the spin axis can change the spin rate. And then there’s ice sitting on land. At the moment, each year, thanks to Climate Change, about a billion tons of ice on land are melting and flowing downhill into the oceans. That water is getting closer to the North-South spin axis of the earth, and just like our skater moving their arms inwards, the Earth speeds up its rotation speed. But so far, that’s just the thin crust and the atmosphere. There’s a lot more Earth before we get to the centre Reaching down from the thin crust to about halfway to the centre of the Earth is the mantle – molten hot gloopy rock that can move. Inside the mantle is a ball of liquid iron, and inside that, is a ball of solid iron.  The mantle and the core are the vast majority of the Earth. We have not measured any changes down there that could have led to changes in the spin rate of the Earth – but maybe we’re not very good at measuring that far down. Anyway, how do we actually measure the change in the spin of the Earth, and what effects will it have on us? Well, it’s pretty interesting, so I’ll spin you a tale on that next time.",401.984,6.699733333333333,/Users/samhardy/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/earth-is-accelerating-pt2.mp3,/Users/samhardy/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/earth-is-accelerating-pt2.txt,earth-is-accelerating-pt2,713,106.42214615507086
"Now, for people with heroin addiction, treatment programs can be lifesaving but it doesn't mean a life without stigma. I've been speaking to Shay who says that despite raising a family and working as a disability carer, she still feels like she can't be honest with people about the fact she's on methadone. We decided to go on methadone because it was much more stabilising for us. We did want to be using, we just couldn't afford to use all the time. Methadone is great, it's fantastic, it has been a great leveller for me, but it's different as well. So I'm dosed by a doctor every three months, we see the doctor, and I go to a chemist to pick up my methadone, and I have a certain about of takeaways, so I dose myself each day, I have one dose each morning. As a worker, you need to that flexibility. At least with methadone I can…at first maybe when it's compounding in your system for the first week or so until you are stabilised, you might be a bit out of it, but after that it's just keeping you regulated really, like on a constant level. Can you talk about the stigma that you've experienced? Particularly when my children were young, and I kept it secret for quite some time until I thought that I could trust a person that I had become quite close to, living in the region for eight or nine years, and when I told them, within a week or so I could just tell that that person had divulged it to others in the community, and the whole attitude of people towards me was incredibly different, to the point where my kids wouldn't be invited to people's places and things like that, or people behaved very differently. And also you find that in some chemists they will…no matter how long you've been there, whether you've been there for 15, 20 years even, you never anticipate you're going to be on methadone for that long, but it ends up just creeping up on you, and I didn't think I'd be someone who might be on it for the rest of my life but I've come to the conclusion that maybe I will be. But it shouldn't matter, it shouldn't make any difference because I'm functioning, I work, I try and support as many people as I can, and I'm really passionate about helping people, so I'm actually a support worker, I work with disabled people. That was another place where I was really badly discriminated against, but I couldn't tell everyone properly what had happened. You know, it's so sad that I can't be truthful about who I am and my name because if people knew, then maybe they would change their philosophy, their picture or the way they see people who are 'junkies'. Trying to be open to people, and if they are drug users, they still have so much to offer. Everyone, no matter who you are, you all have something to offer. And please, if someone is taking drugs and wants to tell their truth to you, some way together there has to be a way to move through it, to make it more acceptable, to gently ease and be more open to people who are on drugs. We have so much to offer society. So, what do we do about stigma and addiction and what is best-practice in Australia when it comes to helping people with opiate addiction? Here's Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre. Welcome Michael. Hello. What sits behind stigma? Well, when we look at drug dependence and injecting drug use, it's one of the most stigmatised conditions of all health conditions. One of the things behind it is a sort of moral judgement on people rather than viewing this as an illness that is understandable, and a lot of false beliefs are built around it. And one of the approaches to this of course is to get people to understand the conditions better, understand the treatments, and understand particularly the benefits of treatment. There is a lot of work to be done to reduce the stigma around this condition. So, you are involved in the Stigma Indicators Monitoring Project. What does that look at? Well, I'm very peripherally involved. That is led by Professor Carla Treloar in the Centre for Social Research, and the real aim of that is looking at a range of conditions that are stigmatised, and trying to develop approaches to reduce stigma. You've talked about this before as looking at it as a health problem rather than a moral problem. What can we actually do to shift the needle on that as a society? I think it's like those programs, questions you could ask, getting people to have a better understanding of the conditions, getting people to understand, for instance, the effectiveness, the treatment for opiate dependence, that it is a life-saving treatment, reduces mortality very significantly, improves well-being, and works very well, and it's to get people to know that there are good answers available and to understand it's important to make that sort of treatment available to people and to be humanitarian and sympathetic around the availability of it. We heard Shay talking before about methadone, which has been in use for quite a while, but there are other treatment options available. What does best-practice look like in Australia at the moment? Well, the best practice is maintenance treatment, whether it be with methadone, oral buprenorphine, or possibly now we have a new treatment which is long-acting depot buprenorphine which you can take for a week or a month, and any of those treatments, they are broadly comparable, there are minor variations between them, but they are the treatments that have a good strong evidence base behind them. The interesting thing about the depot stuff is that it frees up people from some of the exposure so they don't have to go to the chemist, it's more invisible, and we think that actually has had an impact, it makes it easier for people to be very discreet about their treatment. Right, so it might not erase the stigma, but it reduces their exposure to it, I suppose. Yes, as Shay described there, it wasn't attending the chemist, it was actually telling somebody confidentially about her treatment that resulted in her experience of increased social exclusion, and that's not an uncommon experience. So it's not just about the treatment, it's about the condition and people making judgement. Once they know you've got this condition, they make an association that you've been involved in crime and you've been involved in a lot of other things, when that may not necessarily be the case. So you mentioned a few different substances there before, and we've already talked about methadone. Switzerland has a heroin program. Is that something we should consider? Well, the evidence on it shows that it works for people, particularly some of the studies show that it works for people who are refractory to the more conventional treatments. It is expensive, and it would be possible to provide it for some people, and it's something in terms of some people, some form of injectable treatment should be put into consideration in Australia. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, it really is also about perspective, isn't it. If the perspective is that drugs are inherently bad, then that's a really tough sell. If the perspective is that people should be given safe ability to live healthily, perhaps it shifts that a bit. Yes, well, I think the destigmatisation approach is to give people the facts for them to understand, for instance, the significant reduction in mortality, the fact that we have in the last 30 to 40 years there is very low rates of HIV in Australia because of these approaches to people who inject drugs, and to understand that there is a big success story around how opioid dependence has been managed in Australia. So really a shifting and an updating of people's understanding. Michael, thanks so much for joining us. You're welcome, thank you.

"But we begin with Jeremy Leggett, former professor at Imperial College and Oxford, with his massive project in a world-famous setting. Highlands Rewilding is a new type of company, it's a mass ownership company, and it's going to do its level best to accelerate nature recovery in the Highlands of Scotland so as to contribute to repair of climate meltdown and biodiversity collapse. That's some remit, isn't it. Jeremy Leggett, could you place us? Where are we? I know down below is Loch Ness, but Loch Ness, much to my surprise, is very, very long. So, where are we? We are halfway along Loch Ness, about 16 miles from a fairly big city, Inverness, the capital of the Highlands of Scotland. And despite the proximity to that city, we are in a really wild place. There's 1,200 acres on this estate that we're managing, and not many footpaths and there's a lot of genuine wildland in our mixed habitats of native woodlands, peatlands, pasture, heathland and coniferous plantations. How long is Loch Ness? Because I thought it was like a sort of big lake, but it isn't. Yes, it's a huge freshwater lake, I think it's about 50 miles long approximately, and it's a very, very impressive body of water indeed. There's a rumour you own half of it. Well, temporarily custodianship of them, and in the estate papers it does say that we own the Loch out to the midpoint, but I don't know, I think we probably need a navy to enforce any kind of sense of ownership. If it's the deepest part, is that where Nessie might be, is that where the monster might hide? That's what various locals have pointed out to me; if we own the deepest part or half of the deepest part of Loch Ness, then possibly we own the Loch Ness monster. Which would be quite amusing if it were true, but still…looking at the huge estate, we've got a wonderful garden we're sitting on, which goes down the hill, and then range after range of hillside, mountains and so on, all covered in trees. The one thing that is really surprising about what you're doing is you're removing many of the trees so as to achieve…what? Well, helping with climate and biodiversity. And it's really interesting, I set out on this exercise, as you know, as a long-term climate campaigner with no particular expertise, so I spent the first year conferring with all and sundry, all the experts I could attract to come here, and there were a good few, and they all disagreed with each other on how you should go about nature recovery. But the one thing that they all agreed on was get rid of the monoculture plantations, they should never have been planted the way they were, particularly on the peatland. Very bad for biodiversity and not very good for carbon either. So that's what we've done, we've acted on that. And if someone had said to me that as a long-term environmentalist you'll end up cutting down thousands of trees, I'd have said a couple of years ago 'you must be balmy', but that is exactly what has happened. Are those pines? Yes, they are spruce trees, and the Sitka spruce is the great enemy of ecologists. I show ecologists around this place and they pluck the Sitka spruce saplings out of the ground where they have regenerated. And I suppose what you are trying to do is re-establish what was here. But the problem is that if you are trying to have an effect on carbon emissions and such like, pine trees grow fairly quickly, I presume, and your replacement will take a few years to achieve. Yes, you have to put your faith in the long-term system, and there's very good science to show that the broadleaf, a mixture of native species does take down more carbon over the lifetime of the tree, so that's one of the reasons you go for it. Another reason is that in the mix of native species you have resilience, resilience to the kind of pests we are going to see spreading in the warming world. And the other thing we've noticed, quite remarkable this, we are having many more windstorms now, severe ones, we had three named storms in a week earlier this year as a result of climate change, and they knock the conifers over like soldiers being mown down on the Somme. The broadleafs, they take a bit of a battering but they do much, much better. Even broadleafs like oak? Yes, and we have a very rare stretch of oak woodland down on the lower Loch Ness slope. I take tree ecologists into that place and they start swooning at how wonderful it is. Some of them think it's a strip of temperate Atlantic rainforest, of which there is very little left in the United Kingdom, and so it's a special duty, not just to enhance biodiversity, as we are trying to do in various ways, but to protect what we've got because it has become so vanishingly rare. And earlier you said that you could see trees going off into the distance, but actually the far range of hills is as bald as a coot, and that's because of sheep and human practices, desperation to shoot deer, and that has denuded those mountains of pretty much everything. When you explore this area, as I have tried to briefly in my quick visit, you see the variety of landscape, and it includes peat bogs, in other words, where you don't have trees necessarily established, you've got depth of peat which goes down metres. Are they lasting or are they too in danger? Well, they are in danger, they can dry out and they can burn, and most of Scotland's peat, of which there is a vast amount, is in a poor condition. We have an area of…a very large peat bog, it's only 13% of the area of the estate, but we've measured the depth of the peat, it's up to four metres thick, and that means there's up to ten times more carbon in that peat then there is in all these woodlands, 70% of the estate covered in varied woodlands. And the other thing we've discovered is that it's emitting so much carbon dioxide that it's actually cancelling out the amount that is coming down into the trees. So this at first pass seems like terrifically bad news, but actually there is a glass-half-full approach to that which is that actually you can fix it fairly easily. What you have to do is cut down the conifer plantations that should never have been put on the peat, number one. And number two, you block the drainage channels, you do everything you can to keep water in the peat area so that the sphagnum mosses can grow and prosper and that's what takes the carbon down out of the atmosphere. What is peat actually? Well, it's just a long accumulation of organic matter, it's very rich in carbon, that comes from the accumulation of the mosses that make the surface of the peat bog over time, and four metres, that is roughly 4,000 years’ worth of peat accumulation since the ice retreated from Scotland. Plenty of peat in Australia, and tragically some of it sometimes is on fire, with fires lasting years. Incredible, isn't it. Yes, and that's my big fear as I sit here in something approaching a paradise, looking out at these woodlands and the peatlands, although they are pretty degraded, they are rather special when the heather comes out in August, and I worry that at some point if we don't really start turning the tide on climate change, I or my descendants are going to be watching this stuff burn. Fortunately you have assistance from science and you've got a team coming soon from Oxford. It's postdocs, is it? Yes, and full professors. It's very exciting because the entire university has decided they are going to set up a centre on nature recovery. All the multiple departments that you would think ought to be interested in this are interested. It's a 10-year program, massively funded by the Leverhulme Trust, and they're going to be deploying not just the academics but postdocs as well, joining the team that I've been lucky enough to attract here anyway, which is led by two world-class midcareer scientists with a chief data scientist who is joining them at the end of the month who basically ran much of the data analysis for the British civil service and she got an OBE for that, Cathy Atkinson, and she has decided to abscond to help us crunch our numbers in nature recovery in Scotland because we are hoping not just to perform very well ourselves on our two estates but help other landowners to change their land management practices so that we can scale nature recovery. All happening around Loch Ness. And it's a long, long way, of course, from the whole of Australia, but is what you are doing an example of what could be done in terms of examination of biodiversity and restoration, rewilding, if you like, to some extent, that could be done anywhere? Yes, it is part of what has to happen globally. Obviously it will vary in its approaches to land management in different land types, but that's a universal challenge that we all have. The other aspect of course is the aspect of community, we will never beat these existential threats unless we have full engagement, full fighting power of local communities, and we are trying very hard to do that in Scotland, and that applies whether you are talking about the Highlands of Scotland, the Amazonian rainforest or the Australian outback. Dr Jeremy Leggett, once of solar fame, now in the Highlands rewilding. His favourite trees are those native oaks he mentioned.",594.32,9.905333333333335,/Users/samhardy/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/audio/rewilding-the-scottish-highlands.mp3,/Users/samhardy/Desktop/blog/blog-os-asr/output/radio_national_podcasts/transcripts/rewilding-the-scottish-highlands.txt,rewilding-the-scottish-highlands,1663,167.8893525373536
