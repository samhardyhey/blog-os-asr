G’day, Dr Karl here. Now last time, I talked about how over the last few years, the spin of the Earth has suddenly accelerated. This is totally against the long-term trend of the last one-and-a-half billion years, where the spin of the Earth has been gradually slowing down. In the combined Earth-Moon system, there are well-known interactions that will slow the spin of the Earth. But what can happen to our solitary spinning planet that can make it change speed? Well, if the Earth was a solid, smooth, rigid ball, then the answer is easy - nothing.  But, the earth is much more complicated. First, it has an atmosphere, which weighs about 5,000 trillion tons. Changes in the atmosphere can affect the spin of the Earth In an El Niño year, stronger winds can slow down the Earth’s spin, to make the days longer. And other weather patterns can also affect the spin. The Andes mountain chain in South America is incredibly narrow , very long , and surprisingly high .  Because they run virtually North-South while the winds usually blow either East or West, and because they are so long and so high, they are very effective at shifting energy from the wind into the spinning Earth. The Andes - they are like a giant sail in the wind. Depending on which way the winds are hitting the Andes, the Earth can speed up or slow down. We have measured changes in the length of the day of about 0.2 millisecond, caused just by the wind on the Andes. Second, let’s look at the surface of the earth. The Earth’s surface is a complex mess of oceans , glaciers , and continents . All this happens in the Earth’s crust, which is about 6-60 kilometres thick. Sometimes, a sizeable chunk of that crust can suddenly shift. In 2004, an earthquake in the Indian Ocean set off the terrible tsunami that killed about a quarter of a million people in 14 countries. But it also shifted enough rock to make the day shorter by 3 microseconds . The Fukushima earthquake of 2011 shortened the length of the day by 1.8 microseconds. But these were little blips in the overall trend. What we are seeing now are changes a thousand times bigger – milliseconds, not microseconds. And still looking at Earth’s surface, what about the 70% that is water? Surprisingly, the oceans are not dead flat. They can have dips , which can happen when a huge pool of warm water accumulates in one area. Or the oceans can have bulges . We’ve seen this change happen in ocean currents with El Niño. Of course, given enough time, these dips and bulges will eventually smooth out. But in the short-term of days to months, these dips and bulges can sit there, and so the mass of water is not evenly distributed. So it’s like our skater spinning on one leg - shifting mass closer to, or further from, the spin axis can change the spin rate. And then there’s ice sitting on land. At the moment, each year, thanks to Climate Change, about a billion tons of ice on land are melting and flowing downhill into the oceans. That water is getting closer to the North-South spin axis of the earth, and just like our skater moving their arms inwards, the Earth speeds up its rotation speed. But so far, that’s just the thin crust and the atmosphere. There’s a lot more Earth before we get to the centre Reaching down from the thin crust to about halfway to the centre of the Earth is the mantle – molten hot gloopy rock that can move. Inside the mantle is a ball of liquid iron, and inside that, is a ball of solid iron.  The mantle and the core are the vast majority of the Earth. We have not measured any changes down there that could have led to changes in the spin rate of the Earth – but maybe we’re not very good at measuring that far down. Anyway, how do we actually measure the change in the spin of the Earth, and what effects will it have on us? Well, it’s pretty interesting, so I’ll spin you a tale on that next time.
