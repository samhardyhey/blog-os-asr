So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered the story of a man who was hospitalised with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps, increased thirst, and he had also lost close to 13 kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and it was vitamin D overdose, was it? Yes, vitamin D supplements, he had been taking way too many of them. And I don't know if it's just me but it feels like everywhere that I look I'm seeing other people ODing on vitamin. There was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D, there were women who have accidentally taken so much vitamin B6 that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at ABC Melbourne. Yes, if a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Exactly. So we're going to take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr Ian Musgrave who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi Ian. Hello, how are you? Good. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell. Vitamin overdose is certainly a thing but it seems to come in waves. For example, a lot of the vitamin D overdosing is occurring because people have thought that it might be a good way to prevent Covid. Sadly, tragically it's virtually useless as a preventative for Covid. One of the problems with the B6 is that, as your colleague has said, we all know that vitamins are important for us, we all know that we need vitamins for health, but we think that because a little bit is good for us, a lot maybe is better. And sadly, tragically with vitamins, this isn't true. And also what people don't realise is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what has happened with one person, for example, is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained B6, and it all added up so they ended up with B6 toxicity. It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realising. Yes, indeed. Unless you pay very close attention to what you're taking, you may not understand that there is enough vitamin B in everything you are taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects, especially the water-soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as having potentially toxic effects. But, for example, B6 is one where it's relatively easy to get up to a dose which can cause nerve damage. So we don't necessarily see it as being toxic per se, but if you were taking more than 300, 500 milligrams of B6 over time, it can cause nerve damage. It's something that's not really widely known because until the advent of high potency vitamin supplements, the chances of getting a B6 overdose were marginal. Yes, you weren't going to see it just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? If it's possible to get these sorts of effects, do people need to be better informed byâ€¦presumably a lot of the time you are buying them from a pharmacist or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a naturopath or something like that. Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well, they are regulated like medicines in Australia, but having said that I would like to point out that within Australia medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and they are regulated on two levels. You have low risk medicines, like vitamins, which are regulated by the Australian Registry of Therapeutic Goods where you don't need to require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it because they are assuming that you will read the instructions on the box and take them accordingly. And the registered medicines, which are things like, for example, paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence of them working but also strong evidence about their safety. The upshot is read those labels. Yes, and if it doesn't have an AUSTL or AUSSTAR number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much Dr Ian Musgrave for joining us. Thank you.
