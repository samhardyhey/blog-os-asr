Now, for people with heroin addiction, treatment programs can be lifesaving but it doesn't mean a life without stigma. I've been speaking to Shay who says that despite raising a family and working as a disability carer, she still feels like she can't be honest with people about the fact she's on methadone. We decided to go on methadone because it was much more stabilising for us. We did want to be using, we just couldn't afford to use all the time. Methadone is great, it's fantastic, it has been a great leveller for me, but it's different as well. So I'm dosed by a doctor every three months, we see the doctor, and I go to a chemist to pick up my methadone, and I have a certain about of takeaways, so I dose myself each day, I have one dose each morning. As a worker, you need to that flexibility. At least with methadone I can…at first maybe when it's compounding in your system for the first week or so until you are stabilised, you might be a bit out of it, but after that it's just keeping you regulated really, like on a constant level. Can you talk about the stigma that you've experienced? Particularly when my children were young, and I kept it secret for quite some time until I thought that I could trust a person that I had become quite close to, living in the region for eight or nine years, and when I told them, within a week or so I could just tell that that person had divulged it to others in the community, and the whole attitude of people towards me was incredibly different, to the point where my kids wouldn't be invited to people's places and things like that, or people behaved very differently. And also you find that in some chemists they will…no matter how long you've been there, whether you've been there for 15, 20 years even, you never anticipate you're going to be on methadone for that long, but it ends up just creeping up on you, and I didn't think I'd be someone who might be on it for the rest of my life but I've come to the conclusion that maybe I will be. But it shouldn't matter, it shouldn't make any difference because I'm functioning, I work, I try and support as many people as I can, and I'm really passionate about helping people, so I'm actually a support worker, I work with disabled people. That was another place where I was really badly discriminated against, but I couldn't tell everyone properly what had happened. You know, it's so sad that I can't be truthful about who I am and my name because if people knew, then maybe they would change their philosophy, their picture or the way they see people who are 'junkies'. Trying to be open to people, and if they are drug users, they still have so much to offer. Everyone, no matter who you are, you all have something to offer. And please, if someone is taking drugs and wants to tell their truth to you, some way together there has to be a way to move through it, to make it more acceptable, to gently ease and be more open to people who are on drugs. We have so much to offer society. So, what do we do about stigma and addiction and what is best-practice in Australia when it comes to helping people with opiate addiction? Here's Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre. Welcome Michael. Hello. What sits behind stigma? Well, when we look at drug dependence and injecting drug use, it's one of the most stigmatised conditions of all health conditions. One of the things behind it is a sort of moral judgement on people rather than viewing this as an illness that is understandable, and a lot of false beliefs are built around it. And one of the approaches to this of course is to get people to understand the conditions better, understand the treatments, and understand particularly the benefits of treatment. There is a lot of work to be done to reduce the stigma around this condition. So, you are involved in the Stigma Indicators Monitoring Project. What does that look at? Well, I'm very peripherally involved. That is led by Professor Carla Treloar in the Centre for Social Research, and the real aim of that is looking at a range of conditions that are stigmatised, and trying to develop approaches to reduce stigma. You've talked about this before as looking at it as a health problem rather than a moral problem. What can we actually do to shift the needle on that as a society? I think it's like those programs, questions you could ask, getting people to have a better understanding of the conditions, getting people to understand, for instance, the effectiveness, the treatment for opiate dependence, that it is a life-saving treatment, reduces mortality very significantly, improves well-being, and works very well, and it's to get people to know that there are good answers available and to understand it's important to make that sort of treatment available to people and to be humanitarian and sympathetic around the availability of it. We heard Shay talking before about methadone, which has been in use for quite a while, but there are other treatment options available. What does best-practice look like in Australia at the moment? Well, the best practice is maintenance treatment, whether it be with methadone, oral buprenorphine, or possibly now we have a new treatment which is long-acting depot buprenorphine which you can take for a week or a month, and any of those treatments, they are broadly comparable, there are minor variations between them, but they are the treatments that have a good strong evidence base behind them. The interesting thing about the depot stuff is that it frees up people from some of the exposure so they don't have to go to the chemist, it's more invisible, and we think that actually has had an impact, it makes it easier for people to be very discreet about their treatment. Right, so it might not erase the stigma, but it reduces their exposure to it, I suppose. Yes, as Shay described there, it wasn't attending the chemist, it was actually telling somebody confidentially about her treatment that resulted in her experience of increased social exclusion, and that's not an uncommon experience. So it's not just about the treatment, it's about the condition and people making judgement. Once they know you've got this condition, they make an association that you've been involved in crime and you've been involved in a lot of other things, when that may not necessarily be the case. So you mentioned a few different substances there before, and we've already talked about methadone. Switzerland has a heroin program. Is that something we should consider? Well, the evidence on it shows that it works for people, particularly some of the studies show that it works for people who are refractory to the more conventional treatments. It is expensive, and it would be possible to provide it for some people, and it's something in terms of some people, some form of injectable treatment should be put into consideration in Australia. So it's not a one-size-fits-all, it really is also about perspective, isn't it. If the perspective is that drugs are inherently bad, then that's a really tough sell. If the perspective is that people should be given safe ability to live healthily, perhaps it shifts that a bit. Yes, well, I think the destigmatisation approach is to give people the facts for them to understand, for instance, the significant reduction in mortality, the fact that we have in the last 30 to 40 years there is very low rates of HIV in Australia because of these approaches to people who inject drugs, and to understand that there is a big success story around how opioid dependence has been managed in Australia. So really a shifting and an updating of people's understanding. Michael, thanks so much for joining us. You're welcome, thank you.
