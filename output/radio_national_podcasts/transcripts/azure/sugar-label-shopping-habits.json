{"hypothesis": "Food labeling and the amount of added sugar in foods is a hot topic at the moment. Food Standards Australia New Zealand are currently looking at ways to help people choose lower sugar Foods. But a study released on Friday has had a counterintuitive finding that putting warning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them. Well, to talk us through the findings and what they could mean is one of its authors, Miranda Blake, welcome, Miranda. Thank you. Having you taken. So you did an online survey asking people whether they'd liked they'd buy things like breakfast cereal, yogurt, non alcoholic drinks while testing out different styles of sugar warning labels. Were you surprised by the results? Yes, we were. We expected to find that these would affect the likelihood of selecting a high sugar product and we didn't find that. But systematic reviews of face with consumers have found that clearer labeling of added sugar on packaged foods does help consumers to pick lower sugar options. So I would say more research is needed, but we also did find that consumers strongly supported clear labeling of added sugar on packaging. So this suggests that if these labels were being produced, there would be strong consumer support. That policy, right? So people weren't like, they were keen on them, they didn't. But what your founding is didn't really fit with previous findings. What could the disconnect be there? I mean, it's always the probability of just random chance and research. I think also, you know, we found that consumers are strongly supportive of having that information so that they could make an informed decision. So while we, again the research does suggest that providing this information could help consumers to make healthier choices, I think the bottom line is also their consumers deserve to have the information to make that informed decision for themselves, right? Because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in. A product. That's correct. So in Australia, manufacturers packaged foods often add sugar to products like breakfast cereals, yogurts and drinks. But there's currently no way for Australians to know how much added sugar is in a packaged food. So that's why we tested these seven different labeling options to see if any of them had an impact on the likelihood of selecting a high sugar option. Right? So that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered despite the sort of overarching outcome of your study. Are there other reasons as well? Yes. So we know that in order to have any other policies that around added sugar, so for example, if we did education campaigns around added sugar or we restricted the marketing of product line added sugar, we need to know how much added sugar is in product. So it's both important for providing information directly to consumers, but also support other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or more broadly to support consumers to select products that are lower and added sugar. Is this going to be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that warning labels should be on packaging? I hope not, because I hope that they can say that again, we had 85% of consumers who agreed that we need to set higher standards for how the food industry labels the foods we eat. And again, that the broader evidence does suggest that this probably does help consumers to select healthier options. So if we do introduce added sugar labeling policies, which the government is currently considering, that policy would need to be paired with an education campaign for consumers, particularly those with. Lower levels of literacy and numeracy support them in in how to use that information so that they can pick those products while lowering added sugar. So what? How does this fit against other things that are on the table, for example the sugar tax, and whether the new government might be where they might be heading in that direction or not? Well, it would be great to see if the labor government would commit to an added sugar tax either in fruit or drinks, preferably both. But I think what we can see is that again, we need to be able to know how much added sugar is in food before we can introduce any policies. This is a really important step in supporting broader policies to support consumers to eat products with lowering added sugar that are better for their well-being. How do these sorts of interventions interact with each other if you've got more than one thing happening at once, like you've just measured? Nothing in this study, but that's not really how it's gonna work in the real world. Just briefly. That's right. So we know from the example of tobacco regulation, for example, we saw, you know, over many years we had more and more policies were put into place and these can work together so they can be greater than the sum of their parts. So adding to the labeling on its own may be made much more effective, for example, by having education campaigns around the sugar content and attacks around added sugar as well so they can work together to support healthy consumer choices when we're watching closely. Miranda, thanks so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me.
