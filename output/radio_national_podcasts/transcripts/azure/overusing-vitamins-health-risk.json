{"hypothesis": "So, Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered the story of a man who was hospitalised with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps and increased thirst, and he'd also lost close to 13 kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and think it was vitamin D overdose wasn't yes, vitamin D supplements. He'd been taking way too many of them. And I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like everywhere I look I'm seeing other people OD on vitamins. There was another there was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D there were women who've accidentally taken so much vitamin B6 that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at ABC. Open? Yeah. If a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Well, exactly. So we're gonna take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr. Ian Musgrave, who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi, Ian. Hello. How are you? Good. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell vitamin overdose. Is a certainly a thing, and then it seems to come in waves. For example, a a lot of the vitamin D overdose thing is occurring because people have thought that it might be a good way to prevent COVID. Sadly, tragically, it's virtually useless as a preventative for COVID vitamin B1. Of the problems with the B6 is that as your colleagues. We all know that vitamins are important for us. We all know that we need vitamins for health, but we think that that because a little bit is good for us, a lot maybe is better. And sadly, tragically, with vitamins this isn't true. And so people are. And what also what people don't realize is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what's happened with one person, for example? Is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained the B6 and it all added up, so they ended up with B6 toxicity, right? So you've got it from multiple different sources also? Sorry, could you say that again please? It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realising. Yes, indeed. So you you unless you pay very close attention to what you were taking, you may not understand that there's a vitamin A, enough vitamin B, and everything you're taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects. Especially the water soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as as having potentially toxic effects. But for example, B6 is 1 where it's relatively easy to get up to a a dose which can cause nerve damage. So otherwise, it's not necessarily we don't necessarily think of as being toxic per say, but if you're taking more than between 300 to 500 milligrams of. These six over time it can cause nerve damage and it it's it's something that's not really widely known because until until the advent of high potency. The vitamin supplements. You know, the chances of getting a B6 overdose were marginal. Yeah, you weren't going to see it in if just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? If it's possible to get these sorts of effects? Do people need to be better informed by presumably a lot of the time you're buying them from a pharmacist? Or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a naturopath or something like that? Do they need to be regulated a bit more? Like medicine rather than like food. Well, they are regulated by medicines and it's like medicines in Australia. But having said that I would like to point out that within Australia medicines are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and they're regulated on 2 levels. You have low risk medicines like vitamins which are are regulated by these phone registered therapeutic goods. Where you? Where you don't need to. Require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it, because they are. They're assuming that you will read the instructions on the on the box and and take them accordingly and the the registered medicines, which are things like. For example, paracetamol, where we have not only strong evidence of them working, but also strong evidence about their safety right now. So definitely so sorry to cut you off. We're running out of time, but the but we're running out of time. But The upshot is read those labels. Yeah, and if it doesn't have an Austell or Austar number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much, Dr. Ian Musgrave for joining us. Thank you.
