But we begin with Jeremy Leggett, former professor at Imperial College and Oxford, with his massive project in a world-famous setting. Highlands Rewilding is a new type of company, it's a mass ownership company, and it's going to do its level best to accelerate nature recovery in the Highlands of Scotland so as to contribute to repair of climate meltdown and biodiversity collapse. That's some remit, isn't it. Jeremy Leggett, could you place us? Where are we? I know down below is Loch Ness, but Loch Ness, much to my surprise, is very, very long. So, where are we? We are halfway along Loch Ness, about 16 miles from a fairly big city, Inverness, the capital of the Highlands of Scotland. And despite the proximity to that city, we are in a really wild place. There's 1,200 acres on this estate that we're managing, and not many footpaths and there's a lot of genuine wildland in our mixed habitats of native woodlands, peatlands, pasture, heathland and coniferous plantations. How long is Loch Ness? Because I thought it was like a sort of big lake, but it isn't. Yes, it's a huge freshwater lake, I think it's about 50 miles long approximately, and it's a very, very impressive body of water indeed. There's a rumour you own half of it. Well, temporarily custodianship of them, and in the estate papers it does say that we own the Loch out to the midpoint, but I don't know, I think we probably need a navy to enforce any kind of sense of ownership. If it's the deepest part, is that where Nessie might be, is that where the monster might hide? That's what various locals have pointed out to me; if we own the deepest part or half of the deepest part of Loch Ness, then possibly we own the Loch Ness monster. Which would be quite amusing if it were true, but still…looking at the huge estate, we've got a wonderful garden we're sitting on, which goes down the hill, and then range after range of hillside, mountains and so on, all covered in trees. The one thing that is really surprising about what you're doing is you're removing many of the trees so as to achieve…what? Well, helping with climate and biodiversity. And it's really interesting, I set out on this exercise, as you know, as a long-term climate campaigner with no particular expertise, so I spent the first year conferring with all and sundry, all the experts I could attract to come here, and there were a good few, and they all disagreed with each other on how you should go about nature recovery. But the one thing that they all agreed on was get rid of the monoculture plantations, they should never have been planted the way they were, particularly on the peatland. Very bad for biodiversity and not very good for carbon either. So that's what we've done, we've acted on that. And if someone had said to me that as a long-term environmentalist you'll end up cutting down thousands of trees, I'd have said a couple of years ago 'you must be balmy', but that is exactly what has happened. Are those pines? Yes, they are spruce trees, and the Sitka spruce is the great enemy of ecologists. I show ecologists around this place and they pluck the Sitka spruce saplings out of the ground where they have regenerated. And I suppose what you are trying to do is re-establish what was here. But the problem is that if you are trying to have an effect on carbon emissions and such like, pine trees grow fairly quickly, I presume, and your replacement will take a few years to achieve. Yes, you have to put your faith in the long-term system, and there's very good science to show that the broadleaf, a mixture of native species does take down more carbon over the lifetime of the tree, so that's one of the reasons you go for it. Another reason is that in the mix of native species you have resilience, resilience to the kind of pests we are going to see spreading in the warming world. And the other thing we've noticed, quite remarkable this, we are having many more windstorms now, severe ones, we had three named storms in a week earlier this year as a result of climate change, and they knock the conifers over like soldiers being mown down on the Somme. The broadleafs, they take a bit of a battering but they do much, much better. Even broadleafs like oak? Yes, and we have a very rare stretch of oak woodland down on the lower Loch Ness slope. I take tree ecologists into that place and they start swooning at how wonderful it is. Some of them think it's a strip of temperate Atlantic rainforest, of which there is very little left in the United Kingdom, and so it's a special duty, not just to enhance biodiversity, as we are trying to do in various ways, but to protect what we've got because it has become so vanishingly rare. And earlier you said that you could see trees going off into the distance, but actually the far range of hills is as bald as a coot, and that's because of sheep and human practices, desperation to shoot deer, and that has denuded those mountains of pretty much everything. When you explore this area, as I have tried to briefly in my quick visit, you see the variety of landscape, and it includes peat bogs, in other words, where you don't have trees necessarily established, you've got depth of peat which goes down metres. Are they lasting or are they too in danger? Well, they are in danger, they can dry out and they can burn, and most of Scotland's peat, of which there is a vast amount, is in a poor condition. We have an area of…a very large peat bog, it's only 13% of the area of the estate, but we've measured the depth of the peat, it's up to four metres thick, and that means there's up to ten times more carbon in that peat then there is in all these woodlands, 70% of the estate covered in varied woodlands. And the other thing we've discovered is that it's emitting so much carbon dioxide that it's actually cancelling out the amount that is coming down into the trees. So this at first pass seems like terrifically bad news, but actually there is a glass-half-full approach to that which is that actually you can fix it fairly easily. What you have to do is cut down the conifer plantations that should never have been put on the peat, number one. And number two, you block the drainage channels, you do everything you can to keep water in the peat area so that the sphagnum mosses can grow and prosper and that's what takes the carbon down out of the atmosphere. What is peat actually? Well, it's just a long accumulation of organic matter, it's very rich in carbon, that comes from the accumulation of the mosses that make the surface of the peat bog over time, and four metres, that is roughly 4,000 years’ worth of peat accumulation since the ice retreated from Scotland. Plenty of peat in Australia, and tragically some of it sometimes is on fire, with fires lasting years. Incredible, isn't it. Yes, and that's my big fear as I sit here in something approaching a paradise, looking out at these woodlands and the peatlands, although they are pretty degraded, they are rather special when the heather comes out in August, and I worry that at some point if we don't really start turning the tide on climate change, I or my descendants are going to be watching this stuff burn. Fortunately you have assistance from science and you've got a team coming soon from Oxford. It's postdocs, is it? Yes, and full professors. It's very exciting because the entire university has decided they are going to set up a centre on nature recovery. All the multiple departments that you would think ought to be interested in this are interested. It's a 10-year program, massively funded by the Leverhulme Trust, and they're going to be deploying not just the academics but postdocs as well, joining the team that I've been lucky enough to attract here anyway, which is led by two world-class midcareer scientists with a chief data scientist who is joining them at the end of the month who basically ran much of the data analysis for the British civil service and she got an OBE for that, Cathy Atkinson, and she has decided to abscond to help us crunch our numbers in nature recovery in Scotland because we are hoping not just to perform very well ourselves on our two estates but help other landowners to change their land management practices so that we can scale nature recovery. All happening around Loch Ness. And it's a long, long way, of course, from the whole of Australia, but is what you are doing an example of what could be done in terms of examination of biodiversity and restoration, rewilding, if you like, to some extent, that could be done anywhere? Yes, it is part of what has to happen globally. Obviously it will vary in its approaches to land management in different land types, but that's a universal challenge that we all have. The other aspect of course is the aspect of community, we will never beat these existential threats unless we have full engagement, full fighting power of local communities, and we are trying very hard to do that in Scotland, and that applies whether you are talking about the Highlands of Scotland, the Amazonian rainforest or the Australian outback.
