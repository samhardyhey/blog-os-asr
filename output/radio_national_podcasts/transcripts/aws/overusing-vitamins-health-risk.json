{"hypothesis": "So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago we covered the story of a man who was hospitalized with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps and increased thirst. And he also lost close to 13 kg and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with him? I have looked back and it was vitamin D. Overdose. Yes, vitamin D. Supplements. He had been taking way too many of them and I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like everywhere I look, I'm seeing other people od'ing on vitamins. There was another there was a different man who made headlines about overdosing on vitamin D. There were women who have accidentally taken so much vitamin B six that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple sclerosis and the other apparently lost vision in one eye. According to a story by our colleagues at Abc Melbourne. Little is good for you more is not necessarily better. Well, exactly. So we're going to take a closer look at what's going on here with the help of Dr Ian Musgrave who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. Hi Ian. So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise or are we just hearing about it a lot at the moment? Um It's a bit difficult to tell. Vitamin overdose uh is certainly a thing. Um and then it seems to come in waves. For example, a lot of the vitamin D. Overdosing is occurring because people thought that it might be a good way to prevent covid, sadly tragically it's uh actually useless uh as a preventative for covid via and be one of the problems with the B. Six is that, as your colleague has said, we all know that vitamins are important for us. We all know that we need vitamins for health. But we think that that because a little bit is good for us a lot maybe is better. And sadly tragically with vitamins. Uh This isn't true. And so people what also what people don't realize is that the B group vitamins may be present in different kinds of supplements. So what's happened with one person, for example, is that they were taking a number of different supplements and foods which contained uh B. Six and it all added up. So they ended up with B. Six toxicity. Right? So you've got it from multiple different sources, please. It's adding up from different sources without them perhaps realizing. Yes, indeed. So you unless you pay very close attention to what you're taking, you may not understand that there's a vitamin uh enough vitamin B. And everything you're taking to add up to a harmful dose. And again, most people don't think of vitamins having toxic effects. Um The especially the water soluble vitamins like the B group vitamins, we don't think of them as as having potentially toxic effects, but for example, B six is one where it's relatively easy to get up to a a dose which can cause nerve damage. So otherwise it's not necessarily, we don't necessarily think of it as being toxic per se, but if you're taking more than between 305 100 mg of B. Six over time it can cause uh nerve damage. Um And it's something that's not really widely known because until until the advent of high potency um vitamin supplements, the chances of getting a B. Six overdose were marginal, you weren't going to see it in just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better if it's possible to get these sorts of effects? Do people need to be better informed by presumably a lot of the time you're buying them from a pharmacist or you've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, perhaps a natural path or something like that. Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well they are regulated by medicines and um but having said that, I would like to point out that um within Australia medicines are regulated by the therapy goods administration and they're regulated on two levels. You have um low risk medicines like vitamins which are regulated by the Australian registered therapy goods um uh where you where you don't need to uh require prescriptions or require a lot of information about it because they are assuming that you will read the instructions on the on the box and uh and take them accordingly and the the registered medicines which are things like um for example paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence of them working but also strong evidence about their safety, right? So definitely we're running out of time but the we're running out of time. But the upshot is read those labels. Yeah. And if it doesn't have an off steel or star number on it, do not buy it. Thank you so much. Dr Ian Musgrave for joining us. Dr Ian Musgrave is a molecular pharmacologist and toxicologist at the University of Adelaide.", "elapsed_time": 61.89878487586975, "provider": "aws"}
