{"hypothesis": "So Norman, while you were on holidays a few weeks ago, we covered thes story of a man who was hospitalized with vomiting, abdominal pain, leg cramps n increased thirst, And it also lost close to thirteen kilograms and he didn't need to lose that much weight. Do you know what was wrong with Hit? I have looked back and think it was vitamin D, oer os oe. Yes, vitamin D supplements. he've been taking way too many of them and I don't know if it's just Ma, but it feels like everywhere I look I'm seeing other people are doing on vitamins. There was another. There was a different man who made headlines about overnoseing on vitamin D. There were women who've accidentally taken so much vitamin these six that one woman's doctor thought she had multiple Sclirosis, and the other apparently lost vision in one eye, according to a story by our colleagues at Abc Melvun. Yep, if a little is good for you, more is not necessarily better. Well, exactly So we gonna take a close to look at what's going on here with the help of Doctor An Musgrave, who studies natural pharmacology at the University of Adelaid, Hi Ian, Hello, how are you good? So is vitamin overdose actually on the rise, or are we just hearing about it a lot of the moment? It's a bit difficult to tell Mor. An overdise is certainly a theng when it seems to come in wibes. For example, a lot of the vortamin Dte overdose sea is occurring because people ar footcought that it might be a goodway to prevent cover. Sadly, tragically, I useless as a a commenity of the covert vitamin B by the problems with the B six is that, as your colleague is, said Tha eoll, know that Op vitamins are important for us. We all know that we need our vitamins for health, but we think that that because a little bit is good, Rusel might be is better, and sadly, tragically with vitamens, this isn't true. And so people ata, or what? A? Also, what people don't realize is that the big roup Vitamans may be present in different kinds of subtlments, So whats happened? One persen, for example, is that they were taking a number of different Am suntlements and foods which contained Bs, and it all ended up, so they ended up with basic toxicity. Right, so you've got it from multiple different sources on short Edding. Aat, Osid, the game, please. They that it's adding out from different sources without in perhaps realizing. Yes, indeed, soyu. unless you pay not very close attention to what you're thinking, you may not understand that there'sm a Vtm anupotumbeing, everything he was taking to add up to a armful. Those again, Most people don't think of votamins having a toxip, fate. T, especially the water soluble bortoms like the biggrout vitamins. We don't think of them as as having potentially oxcabet, but for example, Basics is a one where it's reelitively easy to get up to a a Aa dose which can cause lurb damage. So it was. It's not necessarily, we donnecessarily think of it as being toxpersay, but if youare taking more than splaing, three hundred five hundred milligrams of for Bsix overtime icon, thocauseumber, damage, and I, it's something that's not really widely known because untila untl, the advent of hih, potency, vionmen, subtlents, the chances of getting a basics overlos were. Margalyeah, you weren't gonna see it in if just from your diet. So what's going on here? Should we be regulating them better? if it's possible to get these sorts of effects? Do people need to be better informed by a? presumably a lot of the time you're buying them from a pharmaciststore? You've been recommended to have them by someone who is in the health sphere, Perhaps a natuapate, something like that, Do they need to be regulated a bit more like medicine rather than like food? Well, why I regula Bome listens in hi this yyeah, but having said that, I would like to point out that within Estrira, medicines are regulated by a therapy goods administration, and they regulated on two level to have low risk medicines like vitamins, which are regulated Wyar these foreign brish therapy goods where you?  On where you don't need to require prescriptions or require a lot of information about Ut, it because they are there, assuming that you will rea the instructions on it on the box, and and type them accordingly, and the the registered medicines, which are things, like, for example, a paracetamol where we have not only strong evidence O than working, but also strong evidence about their safety. Igso, definitely. So definitely sorry to cut you off, E. Sorry to cut. youwe're. running at a time, but thebut the upshot is, read those labels. Yeahand, if it doesn't have an ordale wer ofstar number, honor do not ail. Think you so much, Doctor Ian Mus, grave for joining us, Durgt, A Masgrave is a molecular pharmacologist and toxicologist at the University of Adelaide.", "elapsed_time": 15.006405591964722, "provider": "os"}
