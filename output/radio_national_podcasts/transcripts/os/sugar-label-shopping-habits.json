{"hypothesis": "Food labeling and the amount of added sugar in foods is a hot topic at the moment. Food standards Australia, New Zealand are currently looking at ways to help people choose lower sugar foods, but a study released on Friday has had a counter intuitive finding that putting marning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them well To talk us through the findings and what they could mean as one of its authors, Maround, a Blake, Welcome Miranda, thank you, having you taken. So you did an online survey asking people whether they'd liked. They'd buy things like breakfast cereal, yogut, non alcolic drinks while testing out different styles of sugar warning labels. Were you surprised by the results? Yes, we were. we expected to find that these would affect black hater selecting a high sugar product. And and we didn't find that, but systematic review of Si Wit consumers have found the clear lihbeling of added sugar on package perids. Dogs help consemers to pick lowershit options, So I would say Mariic is naded, but we also did find that consumer strong supported clear labeling of added sugar on packaging, so dissuggest, that if these label words E introduced, there would be strong consuer support for that policy. Right, so people weren't like they were Caen on them. They didn't. H. But what your founding is? It didn't really fit with previous findings. What could the disconnect be there? I mean there's always the probability of just random chance and research. I think, also, you know, we found that consumers a strong support of of having that information so that they could make an informed decision. So Nd While we again, the research does suggest that providings information could help consumers make healthier choices. I think the bottom lineis also, bhe consumrers deserve to have the information to make their informacesm for themselves. Right, because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in a product. That's correct. So in Australia, manufacture the package. Fruth often add sugar to products like breakmer, cerial dogus and drink, but there currently no way for thralians to know how much added Shobert is in a packaged food, though that's why we tested these seven different labeling options to Fae, if any of them had an impact on the lack who is selecting a high shok option. Right, so that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered despite thet sort of over arching outcome of your study? Are there other reasons as well? Yes, so we know that in order to have any other policies though around added sugar, though for example it te did education campaigns around add sugar, or we restricted the marketing of products hin atde. Other, we need to know how much adge sugar is in products, so it's both important for providing information directly to consumer, but alter support at other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or more broadly as the port consumer to select products, but alluwing, added shoga. Is this gonna be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that wanting label should be on Packetn? I hope not, because I hope that they can say that again we had eighty five percent of consumers who agreed, So we need to set higher standards for how the food industry labels the food. We ach, and again that the broader evensor, suggested, This probably does help consumers to select healthyr options. So if we do introduce ad sugar labeling policies which the government is currently considering, that policy would need to be paed with an education campaign for consumers, particularly those with lower levels literry and numericy, support them in in how to use that information so that they can pick thote products with lowering out of go. So what? how does this fit against other things that are on the table? For example, W sugar tax, and wherethe the new government might be, where they might be heading in that direction, Oro. Well, it would be great to see if the Leve government would con commit totheirnaded sugar tax, either in fruit or drink, preferably both. but I think what we can say is that again we need to be able to know how much added sugar than food before we can intoduce any policies. This is a really important step in supporting broahd out policies of the port consumers to at eight pikes of the lawing added to E that are better fo the. Ahow, do these sorts of interventions interact with each other if you've got more than one thing happening at once like you've just measured one thing in this study, But that's not really how it's gonna work in the real world just briefly. That's right, so we know, from the example of tobacco regulation, for example, we, so you know R, many years they hade mor mar policies o puttinto place, and these can work together, so they can be greater than the some of their part, though Addi to the labeing it own, may be made much more effective, for example by having education campaigns Ai antoble contract and attack the round addad sugar as well, so they can work together to support Elthy consumer choices. It's one. we're witching close, Ly Marad. To think so much for joining us.
