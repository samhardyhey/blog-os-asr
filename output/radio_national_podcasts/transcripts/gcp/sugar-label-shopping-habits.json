{"hypothesis": "food labeling and the amount of added sugar in food is a Hot Topic at the moment food standards Australia New Zealand a currently looking at ways to help people choose lowest sugar foods but a study released on Friday has had a counterintuitive finding that putting warning labels about added sugar on packages didn't consistently make people less inclined to buy them through the findings and what they could mean as one of its old is Miranda black welcome Miranda I think having you taken so you didn't online survey asking people with it I'd liked they buy things like breakfast cereal yogurt non-alcoholic drinks while testing at different styles of sugar warning labels will you surprised by the results yes we where are we expected to find that they would affect the likelihood of selecting a high sugar product and we didn't find that but systematic review will fly you switch confuse have found clear labeling of added sugar on packaging. Straws help cook dinner to pick Lois with options sorry I wish I made it clear how did Sugar on packaging sorry suggest that if these labels where's the excuse that would be strong support for that policy would like to paint on them they didn't feel finding is it didn't really fit with previous findings what could the disconnect pay that strongly supportive of having that information so that I could make an informed decision for us while we again about his information could help consumers make healthier choice I think the bottom line so they can see how to say I have to have the information to make an informed decision for themselves because at the moment you can't see how much added sugar is in a product that's correct sorry in Australia manufacture the packaged Foods often add sugar to products life breakfast cereal do I didn't drink but there's currently no way for threatens to know how much added sugar is in a piece. Sorry that's why we tested the seven different labeling options to see if any of them had an impact on the likelihood of selecting a high sugar option so that's one of the reasons why you think it should still be considered the spot that sort of overarching at coming to study are they other reasons as well so if they did education campaigns are on and sugar or we restricted their marketing of products directly taken Sam has but also support other policies that might be at the level of the manufacturer or more broadly is it going to be ammunition for people who disagree with the fact that warning labels should be on Packaging I hope not because I heard that they can say that again we had 85% of consumers who agreed that we need to set high standards the how the food industry label the food we ate again at the Prototype and starts with gas if it's probably God's help consumers Chase like healthier option sorry if we do if your juice I did so reliably policies which the government is currently considering policy would need to be paired with an education campaign for consumers with low levels with c and your mercy support payment and how to use that information so that they can pick a spot ballora pictures so what how does this fit against are the things that are on the table for example of sugar tax and whether the new government might be where they might be heading in that direction or not well it'd be great if they still have a government would commit to learn how to trigger a Saturn throttle drinks but I think what we can say is that we need to be able to avoid any policies this is a really important step in supporting brought up policies how many sorts of interventions interact with each other if you got more than one thing happening at once like you just measured one thing in this study but that's not really how it's going to work in the real world just briefly we die from the example of tobacco regulation for example we still together after they can be greater than the sum of their part may be made much more effective people by having education campaigns choices it's when we listen closely Miranda thanks so much for joining us thank you for preventive health and nutrition and the institute for health transformation at deakin University", "elapsed_time": 130.4625940322876, "provider": "gcp"}
